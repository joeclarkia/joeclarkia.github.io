<CENTER><H3>So what is this "Fire on Campus" thing, anyway??? </H3>
</CENTER></FONT>

<P>Well, about two years ago, I was trying to find some Christian "ministry" that I could do on the computer.  I came up with the idea of publishing this newsletter.  I have been publishing it since February, 1995 (usually once a month, although lately it has been every other month).

<P>As the nameplate on each issue states, this is a newsletter intended for Jefferson High School Christians.  (Jefferson is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, by the way.)  However, it's not by any means limited to Jefferson students.  I welcome anyone and everyone to read and enjoy the articles.

<P>So, with that explanation in mind, why not go <A HREF = "foclist.htm"> back to the F.O.C. Online Directory</A>?
