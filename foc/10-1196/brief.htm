<P>³The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is
Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, and walk out the
door, and deny him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving
world simply finds unbelievable.² - DC Talk: Jesus Freak, Track 4
intro</P>

<P>The more I think about this quote, the more sense it makes, and
the more I realize how true it is. Watch yourself. Remember that
others are watching you, and that they judge God, rightly or wrongly,
based on your words and actions. You can show them the difference
Jesus can make - or you can show them that being a Christian isn¹t
any different than being a nonchristian and that ³Christian² is just
a title, not a way of life. Which attitude do you want people to
have?<BR>

at the flagpole to pray and publicly demonstrate their faith. If you
didn¹t go, you should have. It rocked! We had a blast while attacking
Satan¹s strongholds over our school. If you weren¹t able to go and
you still want to meet other Christians, come to the regularly
scheduled meetings listed above.<BR>
