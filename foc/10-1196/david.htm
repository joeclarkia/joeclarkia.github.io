<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I>FICTION<BR>

by Amanda Leggett</I></B></P>

<P>Dad drove recklessly past all of the cars. ³Hurry, Brad!² my mom
screamed. ³I¹m going 85!² replied Dad. My dad, mom, and I were on our
way to Waterloo, IA. My big brother, David, a freshman at UNI in
Cedar Falls, was in the hospital, due to a severe heart attack.</P>

<P>You see, David has always been the different child. We were both
raised in a strong Christian home, but David had never believed there
was a God. Ever since he was eight, he started hanging out with the
wrong crowd at school. And then, last summer, mom and dad found out
he had started smoking weed. But they couldn¹t really do anything to
him, since he would be leaving for college shortly, anyway. So, it
was a real shock to get a call at around five in the morning, saying
that David was having a heart attack due to weed overdose. I mean,
he¹s just a kid!</P>

<P>As I looked out the window, a salty tear trickled down my cheek.
³Just like Grandpa.² I shook my head sadly at the thought of losing
David, too. David, my only sibling, was having a heart attack. It was
more than I could bear. My face scrunched together, and my mouth
quivered. But then an awful thought occurred to me. ³He¹s not saved!²
my mind screamed, horrified. ³Oh, God,² I silently prayed. ³Please,
if I have a chance left, please help me reach him!²</P>

<P>I cried even harder as I thought of all those times I could have
reached him. If only I hadn¹t been so scared. As I watched my mother
and father, my heart ached for them. I tried to imagine what they
must be going through, losing their unsaved son like that. I don¹t
know why, but all of a sudden, I remembered the day Michael died. I
was in about third grade or so. I remembered it being in the spring
or summer. Mom had the windows and door open. I was reading a book.
David was outside playing ball with his friends. All of a sudden, the
phone rang. ³I¹ll get it!² I shouted. ³No, I will!² Mom yelled back.
She closed her door and picked up the phone. I went back to the
simple world of The Babysitter¹s Club, waiting for Mom to get off the
phone. Thirty minutes later, Mom came out of her room, sniffling like
crazy. Her nose was all red, like she had been crying. ³What¹s wrong,
Mommy?² I had asked concernedly. ³Oh, nothing.² She turned away. ³No,
tell me,² I begged. She looked out of the window, a faraway look in
her eyes. A single tear slithered down her cheek. There was silence
for a moment. My stomach felt weak. ³Maybe Dad got hurt or
something,² I thought. ³A friend of mine died today, Adrienne,² she
began slowly. More silence. ³Mommy, who?² I questioned. ³Someone from
my high school when I was growing up. His name¹s Michael.² I felt
bad. ³How¹d he die?² I asked. ³He was in a coma too long, and his
heart stopped beating,² she explained. ³He was so young. Only 32!²
she screamed. ³He was in our group. We called him Big Lips.² She
didn¹t seem to want to let go. ³I remember the day we all took
Michael¹s glasses!² she tried to laugh at the fond memory, but it was
obvious she was on the verge of crying. Mom went back downstairs to
get the yearbook. I left her alone to remember Michael.</P>

<P>Later on, I asked Mom if Michael was in Heaven. She didn¹t really
know. Somehow, we got into the conversation of talking about David.
³Is he a Christian?² I asked Mom. She paused. ³I don¹t know. He
doesn¹t really talk to me about those sort of things. That would be a
good question to ask him,² Mom said softly.</P>

<P>The next day, David and I played ball outside together. I debated
over whether or not I should ask him if he was a Christian. I was
about to, but chickened out. Since then, there had been other
opportunities. Sitting in the car, I vowed that if I had a chance, I
would tell David about my Jesus.</P>

<P>When we arrived at the parking lot of the hospital, my heart
fluttered. But I couldn¹t back out now! Not when I was so close! I
prayed to God to give me the courage and strength to face David. I
asked Him to soften his heart.</P>

<P>As soon as we had set foot in the waiting room, we saw Kelley,
David¹s steady girlfriend of two years, pacing. ³How¹s he doing?² I
ran up to her and gave her a big bear hug. ³Not so good.² She, too,
looked like she had been crying. ³Yeah. I guess he¹s not doing so
well. They won¹t let anyone in there except the doctors and nurses.²
Standing there, we all huddled together. This was so scary!</P>

<P>A couple hours later, after a lot of praying and waiting, the
doctors let us each go in, one at a time. I was first. The first
glimpse I got of David, he was perched up on his bed, gripping the
bars on the sides for dear life. His hair was greasy, his face
ghost-white. His lips were a funny purple color, and his eyes were
totally glazed over. He looked like a dead person to me! But,
nevertheless, he was my brother, and I had someone very important to
share with him. ³Come on over,² he motioned limply. He tried to
smile. I sat next to him on the edge of the bed. ³Adrienne! I¹m so
freaked!² his voice whispered hoarsely. I took one more look at him,
and burst out crying. ³Oh, David!² I sobbed. It scared me to see
David, my ³tough² big brother of five years, looking so weak. We
hugged tightly. ³David,² I began softly, once the tears had subsided.
³David, you don¹t have to be scared. I have a friend - Jesus - who
loves you so very, very much....²<BR>

<P>How do I lead my friends and family to Christ without them getting
mad at me? What if they don¹t listen to me? How can I stop chickening
out? In the story, Adrienne was going through the very same questions
that you may be wondering about in your own life. Maybe God won¹t put
you through something that dramatic to make you wake up and remember
that, whether you¹re scared about witnessing to them or not, they¹re
going to hell unless you can do something about it. But He does say
you have a responsibility. Romans 10:14 says, ³How can they believe
in the one of whom them have not heard?² And, if you think about it,
how can they if you always chicken out and never give them a chance?
Start praying to God to give you the courage to face them. If they
accept Him, that¹s cool - more glory to God! But if they reject Him,
there¹s nothing you can do but pray about it. Don¹t feel like it¹s
your fault. Only the Spirit can move people. In the mean time, get
your act together. One of the most powerful ways you can witness to a
non-Christian is by your lifestyle. Yeah, maybe you¹ve accepted Jesus
as your Savior, but if you haven¹t made Him ŒLord of your Life,¹ then
your life can¹t ever ³shine for Jesus.² (Matthew 5:16) So, this month
specifically, try working on ³letting your light shine.² Start by
looking up these passages:<BR>

    - Psalm 27 - Romans 12<BR>

    - Psalm 25 - Proverbs 3:5, 6<BR>

    - Matthew 10:19, 20 - I John 1:5-10<BR>
