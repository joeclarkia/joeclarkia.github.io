<P>
For the previous issue, I asked a few of the graduating seniors about their aspirations and goals for the future.  For this issue I thought it would be good to find out some similar information about a few of the incoming freshmen.  Here are the responses I received.  If you see any of these people in your classes or in the hallways next year, be sure to welcome them to Jefferson!

	<DD><FONT SIZE=-1>God's really blessed me with good listening skills and a lot of wisdom.  So a lot of my friends come to me when they're having problems.  I love people and so I'm eager to help them any way I can.  I also have a heart for worship.  I sing all the time - That's usually how you can tell what mood I'm in.  Recently, God told me I needed to be more of a servant, so I'm working on that.  I'm really excited to see God blow everyone's faces off as we impact our school with the fullness of His love and power. </FONT>

[Okay, so Jodi isn¹t exactly a freshman.  Actually, she¹ll be a sophomore this fall.  But this is her first year at Jefferson, and her first year in high school (she was in a junior high school before).]
