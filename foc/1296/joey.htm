Matthew 15:8 NIV</FONT></B></P>

<P>In Jesus' time, the Pharisees (to whom the verse above is
directed) had been faithful in keeping the traditions of the past,
but they had all but taken God out of these traditions as well as
their lives. They had been exceedingly careful to keep the rules, but
they had disregarded the reasons behind the rules. In a very real
way, they had become an entirely superficial society.</P>

<P>Are we any different? Over the last few months, I have noticed a
disturbing pattern in the people around me as well as in my own life.
Although it is an old problem, it seems to be something that is very
difficult to put a concrete end to.</P>

<P>What I'm talking about is the "surface" nature of many people in
their relationship with God, at least in what they say in public
about that relationship. It seems to me that there are many people
who know the "correct" answers - people who have grown up in church
and can quote various passages of Scripture at opportune times. But
by the same token, the rest of their speech and conduct fails to back
up what they say. So it seems that their words are just that - words.
Empty and void.</P>

<P>Sometimes I think we refrain from saying anything in the fear that
if we do say something, we'll just be mouthing the words that we're
expected to say.</P>

<P>I think the root of the problem here is a lack of "realness" of
God in our lives. I'm sure most of you reading this believe that the
Bible is true...that Jesus died for our sins...that he rose from the
dead...that God is looking out for us. But as we go from day to day,
situation to situation, problem to problem, it's all too easy to
neglect our walk with God. Maybe we don't reject God, and don't
completely forget about Him - we just lessen the importance of
spending time with Him (which is bad). I'm sure we could all be
closer to God if we spent more "quality time" with Him, but because
of busy-ness and the tendency to say, "Well, I'll spend time with God
later," sometimes we find ourselves isolated from God. In addition, I
think it's also possible to read the Bible as a textbook and pray as
reciting words to a poem. Even if we do the "right" things, we can
still do them with the wrong attitude and find ourselves once again
isolated from God.</P>

<P>So what about your life? Are you "intimate" with God, as we all
should be? Is Jesus really your "best friend," as he should be? When
you discuss spiritual issues with others, do you mean what you say?
Or are you simply mouthing the words, mindlessly repeating what you
have heard said before?</P>

<P>I hope that during this Advent season, and as the new year begins
next month, we will all resist the urge to be superficial, first of
all with God, and also with those around us. I'm sure we'll all hear
many songs about Jesus' birth and the implications of that
all-important event. But don't just listen to the tunes; hear the
words as well. And don't just listen to the words; believe them. Make
an honest effort over the next month or two to pursue God as you
never have before. I am convinced that God is much bigger and much
better than what we've come to accept. Don't settle for words -
strive to know Jesus as the awesome and intimate God He really
is!<BR>
