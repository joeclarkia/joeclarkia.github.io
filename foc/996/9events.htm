<P>Do you want to meet some new Christian friends (people that go to
Jefferson, but don't go to your church)? Are you looking for some
more Christian support in your classes? Then read this!</P>

<P>Starting September 30, a bunch of cool stuff is happening.
Christian support groups are meeting all throughout the year so that
you can meet other Christians. Sound cool? It will be!</P>

<P>A list of events will be available soon [see below], so keep your
eyes open. Questions? Just call Jonathan Foster (362-1908), Beth
Larsen (390-4394), or Joe Clark (365-8011).</P>
