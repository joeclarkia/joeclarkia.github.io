<P>As I was contemplating my New Year's resolutions over the past few
weeks, I eventually added a fourth one. But then I&nbsp;decided that
it didn't fit in with the style of the other three resolutions...the
other three have to do with improving my personal quality of life --
they are self-focused primarily, although the benefits I think will
benefit others as well. The fourth goal, however -- well, it's sorta
self-focused too, but yet different. It's not a goal that I can meet
with just more willpower and more tracking of my time or something.
It's a mental debate and a bit of a social game that I'll have to
play. So while it is not exactly a new year's resolution, here is
another goal or at least a bit of stuff to think about during the
next year:</P>

<P>Goal: get a girlfriend, and/or decide why as a rule I don't try
harder than I do to find one. The problem with the goal of finding a
girlfriend is that if I want it to be realized I&nbsp;have to
*do*&nbsp;something about it -- something that is not just an
intellectual exercise, but something that affects my mind and heart
both. That's the hard part. I can dream all I&nbsp;want, or complain,
or pine after, or be infatuated, or "observe the beauty around me",
but if I&nbsp;never take action on it, nothing will happen. No one
will up and ask *me* out. That is what life tells me. And the action
taking is the hard part...I have to ask people to do things, and not
just in groups, which is what I always do. I have to risk visiting
the Land of Rejection if I want to not live my life in its
shadows.</P>

<P>Maybe in the dark corners of reality there is something inside me
that values my freedom above the work it takes to find love. Maybe I
value my freedom above love itself. (I cannot convince myself that
this is true of me, although I think some observers of my life think
this about me.)</P>

<P>A corollary to this goal, and maybe the most important part, is to
determine what exactly I *am* willing to do to make this goal a
reality, and then do that.</P>

<P>Test Method: Keep close track of my willingness to ask people on
dates, and spend some hard moments analyzing what that willingness
(or lack thereof) implies. Also, if I have the time (aka priority),
keep track of how many people I ask to do things (and for the sake of
bitterness material, perhaps keep track of what the responses
are).</P>
