<P>Romans 8:28 is one of those verses that is a nice church-phrase.
"All things work together for the good of those who love God and are
called according to His purpose." Many or most Christians learn this
verse very early in their Christian walk. But actually learning how
to live in the truth of the passage perhaps cannot be done until
testing occurs. Or more correctly, perhaps it is testing that drives
the Christian from a naive acceptance of the maxim to a fuller,
better understanding of it. It's one thing for a Christian to quote
the verse like a young child in a flower garden. It's quite another
for one in prison to quote the verse. And it is yet another for an
elderly man who has lived a full life. Perhaps only the aged (or the
otherwise experienced) can best understand the truth of the
verse.</P>

<P>Well, I am not particularly aged or particularly experienced, and
so I sense in myself a rather immature acceptance of the verse. How
much do I really trust God? In my current area of socializing and
building relationships, I see this most clearly. For a very long time
now, I have entertained the idea often that "I'm never more than
second." In my brief experience, I&nbsp;have made tons of
acquaintances, lots of okay friends, but only a few really good
friends (which I think is normal). And in that area of
super-friendships, or girlfriends, or significant others, or
whatever-you-call-it, I see the fact that I have never really dated
anyone (or whatever term you choose to use for it -- courtship, etc).
Thus I have always been second best, or so it seems. Surely it's not
proper to label friendships like this, but in my immature thinking it
comes naturally and often. It sometimes feels like I could be perfect
in every way that I had any control over, and it wouldn't matter. And
(please try and understand) I don't say this just because "I need a
girlfriend." I suppose it boils down to that, but it seems like a
more noble goal -- someone to practice compassion with, someone to
practice unfailing love with, someone to share the starry nights and
trains (well, maybe) with. It would seem to be a worthwhile growing
experience, not just personally, but spiritually as well. I have
heard from at least one person that they really understood love
better after being in "a relationship." I'd like to understand that
better, but have not had the opportunity yet.</P>

<P>Now you see my sentiments for the verse above. In my mind, I can
agree wholeheartedly that this really is not a big problem in the
scheme of God's plan...trusting God will of course allow me to deal
with whatever does or doesn't come my way, and I've learned that that
is a truth. At the same time, though, there is still a longing -- a
dream, if you will -- and I don't quite know what to hope for --
should I follow my mind and foster contentment in whatever case, or
should I reach for the dream? Of course a middle approach is most
appropriate -- keep the dream in mind, but keep my thoughts grounded
in reality. It comes down to the old addage: "Don't seek out Ms.
Right. You focus on being Mr. Right, and God will work out the
rest."</P>

<P>I don't quite know how to express my response to that line of
summation of the issue. I do try to live it out -- and I know that
being Mr. Right is the right attitude for a whole lot more than just
finding my soulmate. And I know in some "deep" part of me that God
will work it out. But the waiting, the apparent unfairness of it, is
disheartening. It is at those times, I believe, that it is most
important not to give up hope -- not to trade my hope for a negative
gloomy attitude -- and to strive to be "Mr. Right" in God's eyes and
not just the eyes of those around me. That is my mission.</P>

<P>Happy day.<BR>
