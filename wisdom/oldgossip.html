<P>You often hear that word today. It seems that everywhere you look
there's a finger pointing at someone saying, "Don't gossip" or
"You're a gossip" or "Stop talking...you're gossiping." Let's take a
look at this.

<P>Why do we gossip? I think we gossip because we're fickle. We in
our lives talk to each other about everything except what's
important, and feel embarrassed when we do say something worth
saying. We say, "Isn't it nice out today," or "That was a hard exam,"
or "Did you get your program to work," but how often do we say
anything of eternal value, any words of encouragement or exhortation?
Seldomly, I think. We are too selfish, or something, to take 5
seconds to compliment someone when they do something of value for us,
and in return we are too selfish to do something nice for someone
else, or even take notice of their presence, or their existence.
Thus, since everyone is frustrated and at times feels like they have
a book on their hearts just waiting to be released, they talk -- to
anyone who will listen. People have problems. Sometimes people just
need an outside perspective, but often it's because the real affected
parties won't listen, and when the people most involved in the
problems won't listen, the people with the problems go through their
list of friends or even strangers, looking for someone -- anyone --
to sympathize with them and encourage them or give them good advice.
What a tragedy that one's closest friends are not willing to offer
this. What are friends for, again? Small talk? Oh, yeah, that's
right. I forgot.

<P>And is this so-called gossiping wrong? Is it wrong to vent to
someone? If so, why? Why is it wrong to share your feelings every
once in a while, to let it be known that you do think and you do
feel, rather than live life as a mindless robot? Of course it's said
to be wrong because usually it involves negative attitudes about
someone else, and that is a problem. It can be character
assassination when the "getting ripped on" party isn't there to
present their side of the case. But the gossipee should know this,
and realize that the gossiper is in fact just venting, and realize
that something isn't true just because a gossiper says it is. Yes, we
all say things we really don't mean. No, we shouldn't say them. But
what other outlet is there? (See the previous paragraph.) Go away and
be quiet is not a good answer.

<P>Even though I'm trying to say here that what we call gossip isn't
always evil, it's still a serious charge to level at someone. But
while we are fickle as people, we're also cruel. We will go around
making jokes and calling each other names. If our words could kill
(or our lack of words), who would be left to tell about it? But do we
learn? Yeah, right. No, we just keep on living the same way over and
over again, hurting each other. Why do we act like that? "Hurt people
hurt people," or so they say. Is it just that, or are some people
just mean? I'm not sure. Is it someone's unchangeable nature,
someone's choice, or someone's environment that makes them be less
than an ideal person?

<P>In my life, in light of all this, I have resolved (a scary word)
to love my friends unconditionally, and hope that they won't ignore
me completely and run away, like they often do. The idea is to take
my mind off of looking for happy friends, and just be a happy friend
to them. "Be a good friend, and don't expect much in return." Someday
it will pay off, I believe, I hope, maybe. For the present though,
being someone's "good friend" for me is always giving and only
occasionally receiving (or not really, it's receiving some of the
time, but at other times being clearly and completely rejected, which
makes the receiving of friendship, what there is of it, seem
completely fake). But I digress...

<P>Anyway, I think we should be careful with our words, but not
silent either. We should strive to live in harmony with everyone, and
harmony doesn't just mean mutual ignore-ance of each other. Ideally,
we should all be able to be friends together and share each others'
time and interests, and talk about things "from the heart." Call me
idealistic...but I see that the ideal is too good to be true in real
life with real people.

<P>As always, if you think I'm wrong, prove it. I try to be
open-minded, although many people try rather diligently to close my
mind by the way they live their lives. But "we can't judge" now, can
we? Whatever. Never criticize. Never talk. Never feel. Never think.
Just keep it to yourself. Like I said, whatever.
