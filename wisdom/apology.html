<P><B>To all those who don't care:<BR>
To those who tolerate my presence<BR>
but are just as happy when I go:<BR>
To those who show little or no love,<BR>
no desire to know who I am in my thoughts:<BR>
To those with their own better friends:<BR>
To those who ignore me in favor of them:...</B>

<P><B>I apologize for trying too hard<BR>
and wanting too much to be your friend.<BR>
I apologize for fretting in my mind<BR>
to find the right words to say,<BR>
finally getting the guts to say them,<BR>
but realizing you don't want to hear my heart anyway.</B>

<P><B>I'm sorry that I wanted to share something more than current
events.<BR>
I'm sorry that I have a heart, and take things personally.<BR>
I'm sorry that I'm not content with status quo.<BR>
I'm sorry that my mind is full of thoughts and questions, but my
mouth is silent.<BR>
I'm sorry I can't share my heart with yours.<BR>
I'm sorry there can't be more.<BR>
I'm sorry neither of us can change.<BR>
I'm sorry for words like these<BR>
that come out when nothing else is permitted.</B>

<P><B>So to my friends<BR>
Who tire of me and my ways<BR>
Who remember my quirks but forget my friendship<BR>
To those who could take me or leave me<BR>
But whom I still care about<BR>
I'm sorry,<BR>
sorry for both our sakes that I can't be more apathetic,<BR>
sorry that I can't stop caring.</B>

<P><B>I'll always hold out the line of friendship to you,<BR>
should you choose to accept it.</B>
