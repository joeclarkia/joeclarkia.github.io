<P><FONT SIZE="-1">It was the last weekend of September, 2001. The
plans had been laid, and the camping commenced....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I took off of work early at 3pm on Friday, Sept
28th, and Rich and I left for Ames with a fairly well-loaded car
(Rich's car) at about 4:30 p.m. We arrived in Ames at about 6:30, and
loaded Heather's belongings into the car. At this time the car had
enough room to fit three people fairly comfortably...then we picked
up Sarah B and "crammed" her stuff in amongst our stuff. We couldn't
have put much more in one car than we did, and still have room for
all four of us. But somehow it all fit, and the four of us -- Rich,
Heather, Sarah, and I -- set out on the open road at about
7:30.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We traveled up I-35 and, following Mapquest's
silly directions, went as far north as Highway 20, then following 20
to a road that went south, and drove on this road back south about 15
miles until we reach highway 175, and took that east about 10 miles
into Eldora. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We arrived at the campground after dark, between
8:30 and 9:00 p.m. We drove around for a bit, and then found our home
at campsite #68, on the north side of Pine Lake (where most or all of
the state park seems to be), close to the fairly new cement trail.
Specifically, we were perhaps a block east of the boat house, and
perhaps half a block from where the trail curves northward toward the
top of the park.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Rich and Heather went to submit our registration
papers, while Sarah and I unpacked the tent and tried to figure out
how to set it up. The directions were not much help, but after a
little brainstorming and staking (and restaking), we had the basic
foundation of the tent laid, and after putting poles in place in a
"this looks right" manner, the tent came together...all together, it
took about an hour to put the tent up. During our setup process, Rich
and Heather came back, then went out to the woods nearby to search
for firewood, and finally came back to help with the final stages of
tent setup.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After we had the tent set up, we "moved in" a bit,
and then Rich started a fire in the nearby firepot with a single
match, some newspaper, and some small twigs. The fire was not large,
but it was large enough to roast our smores for the night. After the
smores, it was bedtime sometime around 11:00 or midnight. Rich and I
did a little singing in the bathroom before bed, and Rich told a
ghost story (the one about lipstick on the mirror with the message,
"Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Saturday morning began rather late for us. Rich
and Heather were awake before me, and I got up at about 9 a.m. Soon
after we started eating breakfast (cereal). Sarah made it out at
about 9:45 or so and finished breakfast with us. We heard stories
about the previous night (from Sarah mostly) about how she now
considered geese annoying birds after the noise they made several
times during the night as they flew over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After breakfast, we set out on our journey. We
walked west on the cement trail, past the boat house. Along the way,
we took note of the tree branches that could be used for firewood,
since we didn't have a lot of it to burn. We eventually made our way
off the main trail and found ourselves on a trail that went under the
main road. Soon we were in a familiar place -- the "ravine" south of
the Quaker Heights camp (where the BCM&nbsp;retreat has been the last
couple of years). We trekked up the ravine and slipped by the Quaker
Heights buildings. We walked along some new grass on the north side
of the campground (close to the field), and then turned west for a
bit, then followed the trail down to the river. The "beach"
immediately off the trail was more of an island, so we walked through
the middle of some weeds and brush to the north until we found a
beach that was actually connected to the land, and went out on
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We spent quite a while on the beach, skipping
stones and seeing if we could hit the log across the river. Sarah got
a few pointers on how to improve her skills. When we had all thrown
entirely too many stones into the river (with somewhat aching muscles
as evidence), we began to search for a way back to Quaker Heights. We
didn't really like the idea of traipsing through the brush again, and
we were still in exploration mode, so we went back a different way.
The first goal was to get across a small body of water to another
part of the main land...this required several minutes of careful
placement of some medium-sized rocks that we could carefully walk on
to get through the water. We made it -- no one fell in -- and
continued on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We walked along a creek bed for a while, finding a
frog or two along the way. Eventually we decided to stop and walk up
the wooded hill. The field that borders Quaker Heights to the north
is at the top of this hill. At the top of the hill we took up our
places in the tall grass beside the field, and talked for awhile (and
sang a modified song about the "Fields of Gold &#91;Green&#93;". Then
we walked along the edge of the field till we were along the north
edge of it. We decided that there wasn't really any way around the
field to the north or east, so we went back the way we came (west and
south), by the Quaker Heights camp again, and back to the main
road.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We were reentering the Pine Lake campground when
we saw that familiar white car (and it's happy honking). It was, of
course, that always timely Seth Loyd. A minute different and we would
have missed each other. But by "coincidence" we were crossing the
main road at nearly the same time, so he saw us. We stopped there and
talked for several minutes, telling him of our adventures for the day
and trying to persuade him to stay for lunch (it was about 1:15 by
now). He told of his meandering morning, taking his time getting to
Eldora and then looking around the campground for us for a half hour
or more. He didn't stay for lunch, but we did allow him to drive us
back to our campsite. It was good to see Seth, even if was for only a
little while.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After Seth left us at the campground, we set out
to building a fire for our hot dog lunch. This fire took about 2
matches to start, once again thanks to our "boy scout" Rich. Lunch
was served, a little belatedly, at around 2 p.m.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After lunch, we set out to find some more firewood
for the evening meal and toast in the morning. Rich and Heather went
down the trail to the west (where we had seen some good wood in the
morning), and Sarah and I looked at places closer to the campsite.
Between the four of us, we ended up with an abundance of wood to be
broken into smaller lengths and sorted by thickness. After we left
the wood at the campsite, we took a rather short walk to the nearby
boat dock or "fish cleaning station" that was a little seasickening.
Then we walked to a closeby lake "peninsula" with no better name than
"the rock place". We sat by the lake for quite a while, talking about
various things and taking a few pictures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After the lake-rock sitting, we walked east of the
campsite, along the trail where it turns north toward the edge of the
park. The sun was setting as we made this walk (about 7 p.m.). At the
very top of the park we saw a small area where some trumpeter swans
were. We also saw some deer in the distance here (as well as a few
other places in the park at other times). Then we walked down the
highway a bit, looking for a good view of the sunset, but we were a
little too late and the corn was a little too high, blocking our
view. We reentered the campground, found our way around an
off-the-sidewalk trail, and eventually made it back to our campsite.
Then it was time to build a fire, this time with charcoal briquettes.
Rich set them up, and lighted them, but the fire died down a little
too soon. We added quite a bit more lighter fluid to the
less-than-optimal briquettes, and Rich lighted them again, this time
in a blaze of fire (and we saw Rich with his quick reflexes as his
arm shot out of the fire where he had lit it with the match). Even
with this second helping, the charcoal did not burn real well, and
when we put our "hoboes" (tin-foil covered packages of meat and
vegetables) in the coals, we weren't sure whether they were hot
enough or not, so we attempted to build a fire over the top of them.
This did not work very well with our wet wood and such until a kind
guy from the campsite next to our gave us some old dry fence laths to
feed the fire. This did the trick, and soon we had a happy fire
again. After about 20 minutes, the meal was served, and I think
everyone was pleased with the results. For dessert we had more
smores.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We stayed up for a bit after eating food, talking
by the fire and such. Then we went to bed, at about 11 p.m. There
were no ghost stories this evening...just a slowly fading
conversation as we all fell asleep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Sunday morning, we again slept in rather late. I
got up (after Rich &amp; Heather) at 9:15. Sarah got up again at
around 10. We ate breakfast (toast) around the fire sort of
informally. One of our goals for the morning was to take the tent
down, which we did without much trouble once the inside was cleaned
out, a task that Sarah &amp; I shared. The tent seemed to be fairly
well dried out, even though the sun had only been over the treetops
for a half hour or so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After packing the tent and getting the campsite
cleaned up, we played a bit of frisbee. This was our last activity
before leaving the campground. When we tired of this game, we left
and headed north two miles to Steamboat Rock. We thought this was a
landmark, but it was actually a city. We found a park just to the
south of Steamboat Rock, so we stopped there near the river to eat
lunch. After lunch, we hadn't quite had enough exploring, so Sarah
led us up (almost STRAIGHT&nbsp;UP) a bluff overlooking the river.
(Sorry Heather) We took a slightly less steep trail down the bluff
again, and ended up a little downstream from where we started. There
was a beach there, so of course I had to skip some more stones. Then
we hiked back through some brush and weeds to the place where we ate,
and then headed back to the car.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">We began our trip back to Ames with a quick stop
at HyVee in Eldora. We made a pitstop there. We left HyVee at about
2:30, and put on Michael (Card)'s Joy in the Journey CD to entertain
us on the way back. We traveled on Hwy 175 straight west to
Interstate 35, instead of going north to 20 first. This ended up
being a more direct and logical path, I think. We got back to Ames
about 3:30, a full hour sooner than happy Mapquest
suggested.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">After returning to Ames, we left Sarah off to
start her busy week of homework (since she avoided it during the
weekend). Then we unloaded Heather's things, and "crashed" in
Heather's room. I visited Seth for a while after that, and talked
with him for a bit and then helped him do some computer work for
CrossSeekers. Then I went back to Heather's room about 5:45, and Rich
&amp;&nbsp;Heather &amp;&nbsp;I went out to Fazoli's and Dairy Queen
for supper (we took both to Inis Grove Park and ate there). We then
went back to Heather's for a bit, and left for Cedar Rapids at about
7:30. Rich and I&nbsp;had a safe and talkative trip, and arrived back
at home from our weekend of happiness and exploration at about 9:30
p.m.</FONT></P>
