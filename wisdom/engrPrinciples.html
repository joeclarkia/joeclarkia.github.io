<P>Okay, after being in the systems engineering world for a couple
years now, I have begun to collect some opinions on how things are
done. I would like to share them for you here. I will add to this
list as I gain more experience.</P>

         <P>Document Principles (1/23/04)</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P><B><I>1) Every document needs a well-known "home"
         filesystem location (what good is a document if you can't
         find it).<BR>
         2)&nbsp;In general, every piece of data needs to have a home
         in a single well-defined document (redundant data is
         inherently hard to keep up to date).</I></B></P>

         <P>Guess the Interface Principle</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P><B><I>If part of the interface design is known, then
         other related parts of the interface should also be known by
         following common sense rules.</I></B></P>

                  <P>Common Prefix/Suffix Corollary</P>
               </TD>
               <TD>
                  <P>When part of an interface uses a particular
                  prefix or suffix, the entire interface should use
                  that same prefix or suffix (where appropriate). Ex:
                  examine errno.h. Each error identifier begins with
                  "E".</P>

                  <P>Related Syntax Corollary</P>
               </TD>
               <TD>
                  <P>When an interface consists of two or more items
                  that are related (transmit and receive, for
                  example), the same style should be used for all
                  related items (ie, transmitData -&gt; receiveData,
                  *NOT* rxData, *NOT* rx_data, *NOT* RxData)</P>
               </TD>

            <TR>
               <TD WIDTH=138>
                  <P>Common Variable Style Corollary</P>
               </TD>
               <TD>
                  <P>If some parts of an interface use a particular
                  variable naming style, all parts of the interface
                  should conform to the same style. Ex: if one
                  variable is transmit_data, the matching function
                  should be receive_data, *NOT* receiveData.</P>

         <P>HappyMad Principle</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P><B><I>When a hard-to-track bug is finally tracked down,
         the one who finds it experiences "happyMadness" that is
         proportional to the time spent searching for the bug.
         HappyMad is so named because the finder is happy that the
         bug has been found, but mad that the bug existed and was
         difficult to track down.</I></B></P>

         <P>Wrong Comments are Evil Principle</P>
      </TD>
      <TD>
         <P>It's hard to keep comments valid. Things change, and when
         they do we recompile our code to make the code work. When
         the code works, we forget to update the comments. This is a
         Bad Thing. <B><I>If comments are wrong, they are of little
         value, since their content cannot be trusted.</I></B> Of
         course some comment differences (different nomenclature for
         the same variable, etc) are minor, but I&nbsp;think the goal
         should still be to have the comments exactly match the code,
         for "beautification" purposes.</P>
