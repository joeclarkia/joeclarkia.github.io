<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I decided recently to start a collection of
tidbits that tend to portray marriage in a bad light. I am not
married (in fact I'm a single-and-pretending-not-to-be-bitter
person), so maybe my discussion of this is flawed. But I think that
if marriage was such an important thing in the eyes of such folks as,
oh, God the Father, maybe we should respect it a little more too.
Remember, these stories are here only because they annoy
me.</FONT></P>

A dietitian was once addressing a large audience in Chicago. "The
material we put into our stomachs is enough to have killed most of us
sitting here, years ago. Red meat is awful. Soft drinks erode your
stomach lining. Chinese food is loaded with MSG. Vegetables can be
disastrous, and none of us realizes the long-term harm caused by the
germs in our drinking water."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"But there is one thing that is the most dangerous
of all and we all have, or will, eat it. Can anyone here tell me what
food it is that causes the most grief and suffering for years after
eating it?"</FONT></P>
