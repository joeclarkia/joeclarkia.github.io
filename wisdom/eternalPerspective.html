<FONT SIZE="-1">Joe Clark ~~ Nov 22, 2003</FONT></CENTER>

<P>As you might know, tomorrow is the wrapup of this year's "40 Days
of Purpose" campaign. My church has joined in on the campaign, and I
have been reading through the accompanying book "The Purpose Driven
Life." The fifth emphasis in the book -- the fifth purpose of life --
is our mission to take the Gospel to everyone. As I was thinking
about this mission, I was reminded of all the typical excuses and
typical reasons why I don't usually share my faith like I should and
why I think if I did people wouldn't listen. Because it came up
earlier in the book, I want to focus on just one here -- the "eternal
perspective" clause.</P>

<P>First of all, if you've been around me much, you know that
I&nbsp;have often made light of "eternal perspective", because at
times it can serve as a convenient copout to explain away things that
are hard to explain. But, in this case, I'm going to relent from
making light of it, and admit that eternal perspective is a key
element of missions and conversion and understanding what the
Christian life is all about.</P>

<P>I would like to relate a brief story. A few weeks ago, as I was on
one of my common trips to Dallas, I was flying high above the clouds.
At that altitude, I was immersed in this Purpose Driven Life book,
and the author was commenting on the reality of eternity. It is not
just a nice idea that we can easily ignore, and (surprisingly) it's
not JUST the hope of resurrection from the dead (since that only
takes us as far as the first moment of eternity), but rather it
really IS&nbsp;real, that it IS forever, that it IS&nbsp;important,
and it IS to be our motivation. 30-something thousand feet up is a
good place to read such lines. It provides adequate separation from
the normal trials and triumphs of life to realize that there is an
entire plane of existence that far transcends what we are used to.
That is the eternal perspective, that is the paradigm shift that we
must have to understand the Gospel in its fullest.</P>

<P>I want to address the point of this little page here to those who
perhaps are struggling to figure out what the point of this whole
Gospel thing is. Perhaps you have friends who are Christians and seem
committed to "saving the world" and such, and it simply makes no
sense. You might say, "Saved from what? The whole world? Huh? Why
can't you be a Christian and let me be a Buddhist or Atheist or
Muslim, etc? What difference does it make, really? If it makes me
happy in this life, shouldn't I&nbsp;be able to believe whatever I
want, as long as I maintain a proper moral ethic in society?"</P>

<P>Well, basically, a necessary starting point is this eternal
perspective. If life is life and that's it, then what's the point
really? If it's only this life we are concerned with, then whatever
leads to the most comfort and the most justice for now is all that's
necessary. If it's only this life, then it's good to live a good
life, it is good to help out those here on earth, but the massive
Gospel effort might be unwarranted. But the point is that this life
is just the first blip on the radar screen. I hate to say such
things, first because all such things are cliche-ish, and second
because to describe eternity we always use a measurable
quantity...this life is just one radar blip among the &lt;big
number&gt; radar blips of eternity, we say. But that is inaccruate.
More correctly, it is one blip among infinite blips. One mile among
infinite miles. It makes no sense. Infinity I cannot comprehend.
Eternity is weird and like trying to fathom a huge <I>limitless</I>
number. But, to understand the motivation of Christian missions, I
think we have to grapple with that infinite/eternal concept. With
that in mind -- that FOREVER destinies hang in the balance -- the
Gospel missions thrust makes a whole lot more sense.</P>

<P>Now, if we can get over the eternity paradigm shift, then we can
begin to discuss the finer points of the Gospel -- God's plan and sin
and redemption, etc. And of course things like God's plan have echoes
of eternity in them as well. But only through the focusing lens of
eternity can Christian missions take its rightful importance. For
those of us who are Christians, and especially for those of us who
are lazy about missions like me, I&nbsp;hope we will remember to
place the lens of eternity before our view when thinking about
missions -- really, and not just in a half-hearted sense -- and in so
doing I think our own drive for missions will be greatly enhanced. I
also think that when we are witnessing and sharing our faith, some
understanding of this foreverness is required for many people to see
the importance of what we are telling them.</P>

<P>So my message is twofold: 1) to non-Christians, if I or another
Christian come on too strongly and it seems like I make a big deal
out of nothing, realize that I am expressing my views based on this
eternal perspective, which implies an imperativeness that otherwise
may not be there. 2) to Christians (myself most definitely included),
I want to encourage a refocusing on eternal things, and a continual
reevaluation of priorities of life in light of eternity.</P>

<P>This is a deep topic, and I probably haven't given it justice. But
sometimes discussing topics like this one just lead me around in
circles, as if I am getting ever closer to the truth but never quite
reaching it (maybe I'm meandering around the figure-eight of the
infinite...). If you have questions, or if you'd like to make a
comment like, "Eternity makes no sense at all!!" I'd be glad to
listen. Email me, or visit the bulletin board and start a "Wise
Thoughts"&nbsp;discussion topic at <A HREF="http://joeclark.no-ip.org/bb" TARGET="_blank">http://joeclark.no-ip.org/bb</A>.</P>
