<P><FONT SIZE="-1">And here I sit, making my reflections after a busy
Tuesday evening, listening to some cute and fantastic (literally)
song (Fields of Gold). It's become official lately: I am in the
throes of reverse-senioritis. What I mean is that this reservoir of
four years of independence and freedom is trickling out before me day
by day. I'm not one for being rebellious and taking my independence
to extremes, but there is something about college life that (it would
seem) is hard to create elsewhere...it may have something to do with
living within a few blocks of most of your best friends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">And I am constantly reminded that this time is
drawing to a close for me. True, I have several months to go. But
from past experience I know how fast time flies, especially in
mid-semester when one's mind is full of thoughts of projects and
homework and exams. I have even likened it to the old phrase, "My
biological clock is ticking." Before I know it, I'll be 30, working
my way up in some lovely computer engineering career, and asking "Is
there nothing more?"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">All right, so it may not be that bad. I'll always
have my faith to motivate me to strive for more than just the working
world, and to provide perspective. Unless I have some large change,
though, even my faith is a struggle at times, a struggle between
belief and doubt. But God enables me to maintain my faith in the
midst of doubt, as has become apparent through the years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">But in all good things in this world there is just
a drop of badness, it seems. In the "good life"&nbsp;of college (or
any span of time), there is the realization that it won't last
forever. In my faith, there is doubt. In the enactment of faith
(church and other things we always hesitate to label as rituals),
there is sometimes a question of whether the ritual has lost its
spiritual aspect. In love, there is the nagging question of if it
still exists. I remind myself of Solomon at times.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Now, being a guy (amid much controversy to the
contrary, yes, I am in fact a guy), I have been quietly distressed
about the lack of, shall we say, a soulmate? Throughout my years at
Iowa State, and in Cedar Rapids before that, I developed many
meaningful relationships, and many more faces smile at me as I walk
by, even if they don't even know my name. This is all well and good,
but there is always a subtle search for more. As I am so fond of
thinking in my self-pity, "I am everyone's friend, and no one's best
friend." I must qualify this. In high school, I tried to gloss over
this, but no more: that whole hormone thing affects me too. I have
guy friends. Happy. I have girl &lt;space&gt; friends. Happy. But
removing the space, if you know what I mean, is one thing that
college couldn't teach me. I&nbsp;don't mean to say in as many words,
"I'm sad because I don't have a girlfriend," because that sounds
too...trite, too simplistic...too utterly selfish. But in essence,
that is the overall generalization of my thoughts at many a
moment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Well, I think I spend too much time thinking about
this. So while other people go out on dates and dances and get
engaged and all that, I sit and think about it. Lately, I've realized
that I can be social too. And maybe I'm not completely ugly either
(although that's never been verified). So why is it that I am always
the polite listener to everyone else's love stories, with none to
share of my own? Is it my inhibitions (me? ask someone out?)? Is it
the fear of rejection? Or is it the weight of past experience,
experience that shows me that I can reach the verge of involvement,
but always manage to get shot down in some fashion, usually several
steps before any hope of a reality sets in. I always seem to speak in
parables about these things, because even in writing I feel a
bit...squeamish...about these things. Even you reading this probably
think I'm a whiner for saying any of this. Well, I am. So what else
is new? I tend to write things down when no one else will listen to
what I have to say, so my writing is just the leftovers of my
in-person whining. This is also why I am squeamish: I sense that this
is exactly why I am here writing this sad lonely tale: because I
whine too much. Perhaps this is a self-fulfilling prophecy of some
sort.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Anyway, here I sit, late on a school night,
writing about my lack of love life, not really looking forward to the
day when I will leave what seems to be the best place to interact
with people, and enter the "real world" with its corporate demands,
its distance, and apparently, its loneliness. Yes, I know. I'm just
being impatient. And I'm learning to be more patient. There are just
times when my growing patience takes a day off, and I end up with
blotches of writing like this one. Tomorrow perhaps I will suck it
in, and learn once again to "Not Care" and to keep the better part of
my love safely inside myself, where it can't make anyone think I'm
weird or whining. That way, only I will know the love that I think
I'm capable of. I can say, "they don't know what they're missing" but
that doesn't really help any. As someone once said, "Love isn't love
'til you give it away."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">And then, finally, I'm reminded of the advice that
love isn't all it's cracked up to be..there are quarrels and fights,
and commitment and responsibility, and all that sort of thing. I
wonder though: is that true, or is that just something to make me
feel better? It's easy for someone who's "taken" to advise one who's
not that "takenness" is not all that it appears to be. But it's also
easy for me to long for something for the sake of longing -- in some
selfish fit of "it's greener on the other side," even if that green
is green mold or something, and not grass. Boy, now I've really lost
all sense of point to my writing. Well, that's all I'll say for
tonight. Love is an interesting topic, and I always like to talk
about it, even if my thoughts on it are full of contradictions and
bitterness (hence why no one seriously asks me about it, I
suppose).</FONT></P>
