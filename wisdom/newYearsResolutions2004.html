<P>Over the past month, I've been mulling over what's good and what's
not so good in my life. I've come up with a short list of things that
I want to try to work on more in the upcoming year to improve my
quality of life. I'm trying to focus here on simple, manageable goals
that do not require major lifestyle changes -- in other words, goals
that might actually be met.</P>

<P>1) Spend at least 3 hours per week "communing with the outdoors."
Looking back over the past year, I&nbsp;notice that I have spent tons
and tons of time inside on work projects and personal projects and
class projects. Some of that is necessary, but sometimes I'm just
reading another set of 500 comments on Slashdot or something. So, to
counter this sedentary boring lifestyle, I want to challenge myself
to spend at least three hours each week doing something outside. I
want to leave this very open-ended. I don't have to spend the time
exercising. I don't have to spend the time alone. I don't have to
spend the time in a group. I don't even have to be directly outdoors
(ie, I can be in a car or on a porch). The only rule is that I have
to not be focused more on some other "normal" task than on the task
of communing outside. Notice too that I did not make this goal only
for the summer months...there are ways to spend time outdoors even
during the cold winter months, too. Some guidelines for appropriate
and inappropriate outdoor activities to meet this goal: Outdoor
church services or Bible studies don't count, but outdoor church
social gatherings probably do. Attending or participating in outdoor
sporting events counts (partly because I&nbsp;value the outside part
more than the sporting event part usually). Going for a ride (as long
as "the ride" is a primary focus) counts. Taking the laptop outside
probably doesn't count. Outdoor engineering work doesn't count,
unless it is a focused break period.<BR>
<BR>
Test Method: In order to keep track of my progress in this area, I
will create a chart or calendar on which I can record the time spent
doing my "outdoor-centric" activities.</P>

<P>2) I want to marginalize my life. That sounds a little unusual so
let me explain. This past year especially, I have become quite good
at getting up at 7:25 to get to work by 8am. That leaves just exactly
enough time to do the daily routine and drive to work. This example
and other similar ones in my life may be efficient and all, but they
leave life too hectic, I think. They do not leave enough room for the
"marginal" activities -- listening to a song, reading a chapter in a
book, responding to a friendly email or a phone call -- those things
tend to get lost in a life that has no margins. So I want to work on
increasing the margin of time I allow myself between my pursuits of
busy-ness.</P>

<P>Test Method: Keep track of when I go to sleep and when I get up
(in efforts to get enough sleep but yet get up earlier). Perhaps keep
a daily or weekly journal of my thoughts on the amount of margin I
have been able to uphold for that day or that week.</P>

<P>3)&nbsp;Lose 20 pounds by the end of the year. My weight has been
fairly steady the last couple of years, but "there is more of me to
love" than there should be, so for the sake of health and appearance,
I'd like to lose some weight. Note that this is a year-long goal; I'm
not intending to lose 20 pounds in 2 weeks or even two months. I just
hope to see a gradual decline over time based on smart(er) eating and
exercising habits.</P>

<P>Test Method: Test progress on the scales about once a week, record
results, and generate a graph.</P>
