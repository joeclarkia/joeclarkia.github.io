<P>Wow, I'm not sure I've ever made a list quite like this. I guess
it's sort of an anti-wife list, in a way, as in the qualities about
myself (at least the potential ones that I can find) that prevent me
from finding a spouse. (I know I know, it's up to God to reveal the
right one at the right time...but play along with me here.) Now, I'll
make it clear that...I don't mean to make anyone feel awkward with
this list. I mean, sometimes brutal honesty is avoided at all costs,
for obvious reasons. And in this case, I don't want any of you
readers to feel singled out or any such thing. But, even though I
write this somewhat in jest (a little), I really do wonder about
these issues, and I am afraid that I won't get any truly serious
responses. I guess I really would like honest feedback on these
issues, tough as it may be to take. And of course if you respond in
any way to this, it's not implying anything about whether you're
"interested" in me or not....You can generalize these sayings to say
something like, "Well, this may not relate to me, but I can see in
your life that...." (I wish I&nbsp;could devise a way for you to
respond to this anonymously if you wanted to...maybe I'll work on
that someday.) So it's not just about significant others, it could
also be titled the "Joe Self Betterment Survey", strange as it may
sound to write a survey with such personal content. So with those
thoughts in mind....</P>

<P>Here's a survey for you. Please select all of the choices below
that relate to why you are not willing or able to be interested in me
(Joe) as a significant other:</P>
