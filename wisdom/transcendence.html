<P>I've been thinking for a few days about the topic of
transcendence. I think that that one term ties together some things
that I spend my life thinking about and trying to live out.</P>

<P>Back in 2004, I was particularly enamored with Cedar Lake, so I
made a short video about it and how it is "the place to be." I put
the video to some nature music. I still remember one of the shots
from that video where the sun was glinting off the water in that
sparkly way. Wow. Transcendence.</P>

<P>That's a pretty easy example, but I see this transcendence in a
lot of things, when I look for it. I see it in epic movies. I see it
in history museums. I see it in relationships. I see it in music. I
see it on nature trails and in church services. I see it in the
lenses of telescopes and microscopes. I see it in technology and in
empty fields. I see it in societies and in quiet moments at home.
Basically, it's everywhere. It's not as though it's so expansive as
to be meaningless, but it's, I will say, the part of everything that
reflects the image and the work of God, and our pondering of it is
what turns our hearts and our thoughts to the "bigger picture" of
humanity and God and eternity.</P>

<P>Wow those are big words. Do you believe me? Do you think I'm just
off playing my "paradigm" game on some nice thought tangent? Maybe.
But I like stretching my brain like this sometimes. And it just...
makes sense too.</P>

<P>I read a book a couple days ago (yes, the whole thing) called "The
Divine Romance" by Gene Edwards. In it, he weaves a story about ..
well.. everything, about how God created the universe, the earth,
Adam, and Eve, and about his interactions in the Old Testament with
"Jeru", how things played out during Jesus' life, death, and
resurrection, and how the culmination of history is yet to come when
God is united with "His bride". The story is told as a love story,
about God forming a "counterpart" for Himself. Yeah, that might sound
sorta weird and heretical, but if the Church is "the bride of Christ"
-- well you get the idea. But anyway, it was nice to read that story,
and think about some things, about how God sees individuals and yet
how humanity has a special destiny in God's eyes, about how God can
see the present transpiring and can also look out across time and
eternity as though looking out over a distance.. etc. I'm sure the
metaphors and analogies aren't all exactly right, but the
transcendence aspect is in the attempt. We can't see or understand
all that God is, but... we can imagine, we can dream, we can see
glimpses of it. And, responsible imagining is a pretty cool thing, I
think.</P>

<P>I think my Thomas Merton fanclubism fits into this as well. Merton
talks a lot about solitude, and silence, and finding God in the
depths of contemplation and inner silence (no not in a weird "find
the inner god" way). I think Merton's ideas can be seen as a search
for transcendence too. Or, better put, the search for transcendence
is the search for God in the real world -- the search for the holy in
the normal, the search for transforming the physical realm into
something where we can commune with God.</P>

<P>I also like to consider how this topic can relate to memories.
There's a line in a song about "when our memories turn to gold."
There's something water-sparkly and transcendent about that too. What
is it? I'm not sure. Sometimes we see the "flashes of light"&nbsp;in
life as they happen. Maybe sometimes we only see the true nature of
everyday life when we think back on it. Like, I didn't think much of
the ADM corn smell when I was 12 yrs old watching trains there. But,
when I smell it now (like I did today), it brings back memories of
that time in life, and... it's surreal, and maybe transcendent. Part
of that is just the "reminds me of my childhood"&nbsp;happy feeling,
but... is it purely just a physical neurological thing? I'm going to
entertain the idea that there's more to it. Let's go with the idea
that we as humans were made "in the image of God" with a spark of
eternity living within us. If that's the case, then maybe we
naturally live our moments with some idea of trying to find something
timeless about our existence, something that echoes something inside
us of timelessness. Our memories, while they might just be pictures
stored by chemicals, are a glimpse at something that could be
considered timeless.</P>

<P>Beyond just our memories, there is also an idea of history in
general. When I was walking around at Beverly Park today, I was
thinking about this a little. I was walking on leaves and brush and
getting mud on my shoes from the current year's growth. I was
watching trains go by and cars go by on Highway 30. But I was also
smelling that ADM&nbsp;smell that took me back 15ish years.
I&nbsp;took a look again at the old cars there, and wondered again
about how they got there in the creekbed -- sometime in the past,
there was a story to tell there that is now lost -- and so we'll
guess maybe they've been there for 30 years or so. The ground I was
standing on was probably set aside during some apportionment as the
city expanded in the past 50-100 years. And the ground itself, the
lay of the land, the ups and downs, has been there for probably
thousands of years. Here I am, suspended in the midst of so many
simultaneous stories, and so many bits of history. Put that together,
and there's a form of timelessness and transcendence to that too.
That thought process reminds me that God is eternal, and through all
the ages of all the events that have transpired on that one hilltop,
God was there. With thoughts like those, it doesn't take long to feel
some inspiration.</P>

<P>Then, thinking back to recent days (Christmas), there is a huge
bit of transcendence there. Another topic I've been thinking about
lately is the Incarnation. The emerging folks pick up on this idea
and talk about Incarnational living and bringing Jesus to the world,
etc., but for the moment I want to stick to that capital-I
Incarnation. So, God came to earth in human form. That slides off the
tongue pretty easily. But think about it for a while, and it can be a
lot more than just a line we like to quote. The, well, transcendence
of that act,&nbsp;I think, is as exciting and inexpressible as we
choose to allow it to be. God, who spans beyond all space and all
time and all dimension and all thought, made himself to be one of
us.... let your mind run with that for a while (maybe go see the
Nativity Story to get your mind started).</P>

<P>I also think about human relationships and how they can show this
transcendence as well. People are tricky, and not as clearcut as,
say, a nice wooded forest or a smelly corn plant from the past. This
reminds me of the idea of soulmates, although we don't have to think
in romantic terms with this. But... yeah, we can read about how Adam
and Eve knew God and talked with him face to face when time was still
young and the earth was still free from its corruption and darkness.
We think about all the attributes of God and all the matching
attributes he desires for us to possess and share with those around
us. That is the recipe for transcendent relationships and
transcendent communities, and... it's always a goal. Sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't, but as I go through life, just as I look
for something timeless and sparkly in lakes and in the train horns, I
also look for something even more timeless and even more transcendent
in the people I interact with.</P>

<P>In the Divine Romance book, the story is told of how Jesus during
his life on earth would on occasion just stop what he was doing and
gaze off into space. At those moments, his mind would stretch out
beyond the confines of space-time, and he would think about the
timeless nature of things going on, or see battles in the spiritual
realm, or remember things spoken in spiritual realms millenia ago. It
is those "gaze into space"&nbsp;moments that I think I look for.
Maybe I don't want to actually "zone out"&nbsp;and be a daydreamer (I
can't stop time like Jesus could), but... I want to be aware enough
of my surroundings to see and appreciate the spiritual in the
everyday. I'm also always looking for others who share that same
desire, and... I don't think many people really understand this
transcendence thing. Maybe I'm just out on a limb doing something
weird. Maybe other people find their "transcendence" in some way that
I can't see. I don't know, and I'm not here to judge. I just know
that there's something to it for me, and it makes life a lot more
interesting I think.</P>
