<P>Lately I've been reading a book called "Brave Hearts"&nbsp;by
Sharon Hersh. And while you laugh, yes, the back cover does indeed
say, "For every woman who wants more from her relationships." So it's
officially a "girl book." But it has some interesting things to say,
so I'm reading it anyway, and trying to paraphrase it in guy terms as
necessary. I'd like to take a few moments to discuss one part of the
book, where the author discusses having "passion", loving
extravagantly, avoiding unhealthy control in relationships, etc. It
may be hard to tie these all together sufficiently here, but I'll do
my best.</P>

<P>On page 42 or so, the author talks about reserving our limited
passions -- making choices, choosing to give our passion to one thing
and not to another. This reminded me of a typical situation. Someone
asks someone else on a date, and the other person politely says that
he or she has no time for such things. When I recently heard such a
response between two friends, I didn't think much of it to start
with, but later on I thought it was sort of a copout answer. Yes, we
all have limited amounts of time, and limited amounts of passion. But
I think that we expend our time and our passion on what we choose to.
I think that if "Jane" had really wanted to eat dinner with "John",
she would have said something like, "Well, I'm really busy right now,
but maybe we could work it in" -- and they could figure out some time
to do something. Or if she didn't she could have said, "Um, I don't
think so, weirdo" which is harsh, but I'm not so sure it's much
harsher than the implication of "I'm too busy, go away", when one
thinks about it. Of course, this attitude of, "You would find time if
you cared" is sort of a hard-line approach, and is demanding. I guess
love or whatever you call it is supposed to be infinitely patient,
since it is not to be demanding...either that or it should just give
up easily and move on. That is sort of the double standard of love --
don't push, but don't give up. Living out that double standard is
difficult, especially for someone who doesn't like double standards
and doesn't always have the blessed gift of patience (someone like
me, in other words).</P>

<P>On page 50 the author talks about herself and another person, how
she herself avoids conflict and tries to keep everyone happy, while
the other person is more perfectionistic and idealistic; the author
states that both mentalities are controlling. This begins a
discussion of three types of goals that are controlling:
independence, infatuation, and idealism. Maybe I'm not catching the
full definiton of the terms, but is it bad if I'm all three at the
same time? :-)</P>

<P>I place a fair amount of value on independence. For example, I
think that guys who rely on their wives to sustain them (like some
guys on the sitcoms) are kind of...not ideal. I mean, I think there
has to be balance, but there is a place for independence, and I think
I as a guy should be self-sufficient, at least if I had to be. And
yes, this is rather hypocritical coming from me the guy who hardly
ever cooks anything and doesn't worry much about groceries or bills
and such...so take my words on independence with a grain of salt. The
book talks about valuing tasks over relationships, and there are
definitely times when I think like that (even if it's just out of
bitter cynicism), times when I say, "Why can't people be more like
computers, which usually either work right, or don't work for some
repairable reason?" In other words, I can control computers, and I
can control tasks, but I can't control people. So people annoy me
because I can't control them. Oops for me.</P>

<P>It was also in this section (page 52) that the author says that
independence keeps us from loving "with abandon" as God does. I would
like to know what that means. "Loving with abandon." It sounds
dangerous. It sounds extreme. It sounds like...something I'd like to
find the ability to do. But in life, it seems that loving with
abandon is a silly idea, and people say things like, "You're nice, go
away" or "I hate love" or one of a host of other such love-killing
statements. For God's part, He would seem to say, "Seek me, love me,
serve me, and my love will be with you, and you will realize it and
know my presence...someday." I have this issue with "knowing God,"
mainly because it seems to be very abstract. So people annoy me
because they prevent loving with abandon directly, and God annoys me
(in some hopefully God-honoring way) because the abstractness of the
relationship hinders it. In either case, "loving with abandon" is a
nice idea that seems to be prohibited, or at least foolish and an
easy way to be disappointed. I have probably written before about low
expectations and how that is my (unfortunate) goal because I'd rather
be pleasantly surprised than unpleasantly disappointed; the words in
this paragraph are justification for that conclusion.</P>

<P>Now, the author adds to this business the idea of infatuation, or
controlling and clinging too tightly to relationships. She speaks of
living with desire, but not demanding -- loving with abandon, I
guess, without expecting too much. That seems like a fairly difficult
paradox for me to live out (another double standard?). Of course it
is the exact paradox that I think I *should* live out, but it's a
challenge. If I have desire, it always seems to be demanding, and
it's only by sheer determination that I keep the stupid irrational
stuff under control at times. Then there are the times when I don't
keep it under control, and people throw fits...but such is life.
Love, it seems, wants to see results, wants to be requited, and
loving with abandon in the absence of results -- loving without
demanding more than not much -- seems difficult. Demanding, the
author says, ultimately leaves us alone, and perhaps my life at times
is evidence of that. How to combat this evil demanding of things in
my mind? That is the question of my life, the question that perhaps
someday I'll find an answer to. It's a question that part of me
doesn't want to answer, because loving with abandon seems tied in to
infatuation somehow, even though it probably shouldn't be. Double
standards (or just confusion) once again.</P>

<P>On page 55, the author begins talking about a third controlling
tendency: the goal of idealism. She states that an idealistic heart
is not free to offer extravagant love (or love with abandon as I've
been saying). Apparently this idealism lends itself easily to
legalism and a host of similar things that allow us (potential
extravagant lovers) to be caught up in criticizing and judging those
who we're supposed to be loving. (Often it is not outright criticism
that we involve ourselves in, but the just-as-harmful practice of
tearing ourselves up trying to figure out why people around us act
the way they do, failing to meet our wants and wishes and failing to
match our idealistic goals.) There is a fine line here it seems
between loving others enough to tell them when they're in the wrong
in some area, and being critical of people beyond warrant. I for one
value idealism, and I think in my "mind's eye" I always have some
picture of "the way things should be", and I measure life based on
its closeness to that perfect fake world. Remember what I said about
low expectations? This is probably where this need comes from. I am
caught between seeing the ideal in my mind and living out life in the
world that often doesn't meet with perfection. And it's interesting
and important to note that these "imperfections", these traits that
are criticized, typically do not have to do with sin or anything like
that -- they are simply the life that is not as I choose, the life
that is a product of relating to people, who have their own goals,
and I suspect their own visions of the perfect life. I suppose that
in trying to live out our own perfect lives, we all have similar
issues, trying to resolve the gap between what we wish for and what
we have in real life. And as we go through life seeing the perceived
imperfections, we have no one to blame but ourselves, because we
create our dreams, and it is not a sin when others fail to fulfill
our dreams...the harsh fact of life.</P>

<P>So after this discussion, it seems even moreso that "loving with
abandon" is difficult. What is it? What does it feel like? What are
its boundaries? How long? How much? When should it start? When should
it stop? How does it apply to each person I meet? How do I continue
in this extravagant, unconditional love without it seeming boring or
fruitless? How do I know when I am acting in love, and not some other
thing that only masquerades as such? What is love? What is lust? What
is infatuation? What does it mean to expect too much? What does it
mean to keep one's dreams in mind without using those dreams as a
weapon? So many questions.... There seem to be few easy answers, and
apparently it is only in the practice of living that we find some
sort of answer to the questions. For me at least, it is a struggle
that goes on day by day, and the answer comes in small doses in a
variety of ways. I am confident that as I try to see life objectively
and reach for "the beyond" both spiritually and among fellow humans,
my mind and understanding are being transformed into ones capable of
the right kind of love, but setbacks come easy and are often hard to
see objectively. With this point and counterpoint between thinking I
have it figured out and realizing that it's still a mystery, I am
often tempted to assert that love is a game, a game where the rules
aren't always clear, where the players sometimes change sides, and
where the variables of the game change frequently. But love, with all
it's mystic and mythic properties, is still my goal, since God is
love and it just seems right, in God's word and in real life.</P>

<P>To put it simply: "God, teach me to love with abandon as you
do!"</P>
