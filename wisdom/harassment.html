<P>I recently learned of a troubling situation. A certain employee of
a certain company was let go (aka fired) on grounds of sexual
harassment. From the man's perspective, the conversation in question
was, in reasonable consideration, a very trivial thing. Apparently, a
female coworker was a bit concerned about a third individual who
would appear occasionally at their workplace (this third individual
was carrying out his workplace responsibilities as well). The first
man, hearing the woman's concerns, said off-handedly, "Maybe he
&#91;the third individual&#93; has a crush on you."</P>

<P>Apparently, this was a Very Bad Thing to Say. It was evil and
dastardly and bad. It was disgusting. It was beyond what any
reasonable person should be required to tolerate. It was, simply,
sexual harassment. Or so the woman thought. She reported the
incident, and the man who made the comment was fired from his
position.</P>

<P>Now, first of all, let me say again that this is the man's
perspective. Perhaps there was more involved in the situation -- I
don't know, and I can't know, because it's not my place to find out.
So I'm assuming (yeah, stupid me for assuming) that his story is
basically what really took place. Assuming that the assumption is
somewhat valid...</P>

<P>How Stupid! Maybe he was wrong to say that. It was probably a poor
choice of words. But I bet that I've heard worse things from
respectable folks at church. I think that everyone makes these sorts
of innocent remarks at times. Even if they are inappropriate, the
offended party has a right (responsibility?) to first tell the
"harasser" that they don't appreciate that sort of language. Even if
the harasser doesn't immediately renounce all former words and cower
in fear, the offended party could probably do better than to
immediately report the incident and cause someone to lose their job.
A healthy dose of "a mile in their shoes" could help here. Also in
this there is such a thing as "having a backbone" -- as in people
shouldn't report "harassers" when the harassment is clearly an
isolated trivial comment.</P>

<P>Having said that, I'm not trying to say that sexual harassment
policies are stupid. They are there for a reason, I know, and there
are times when it is appropriate to take disciplinary action. Maybe
I'm wrong, and maybe this was one of those times (due to
circumstances that I was not told about). But at face value, such a
use of sexual harassment policies makes the system seem idiotic.</P>
