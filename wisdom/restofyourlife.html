<P>In my recent thoughts on "vision" and "passion" in life, I came up
with a list of questions that you might find useful in helping to
better understand yourself and what drives you in life. Consider
answering these questions to be a self-learning exercise. Ready?</P>

   15,...)<BR>
   &nbsp;</LI>
   
   <LI>What are your top two goals right now? Where would you like to
   be in 1 month? 6 months? 1 year?<BR>
