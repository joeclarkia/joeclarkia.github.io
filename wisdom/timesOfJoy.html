<P>As I have made my way through life, I have often pondered the
roots of joy. I surely have a number of things to be joyous about,
from my heritage to the blessings God has provided in the last
several years to my eternal destiny. But what are the specific
sources of joy? What are the things in life that take priority in the
"joygiving" category?</P>

<P>I've noticed two broad types of joy. First, there are the joys of
the present and the future. These joys are the things that happen in
daily life that provide great happiness. These are also the things in
life that remind us of the promises God has given us for the future.
The joys of the autumn remind us of the seasons in life, how God is
in charge of them, and how the springtime always follows the winter
season. The joys of friendship remind us of the love and sense of
community that God has placed deep within the heart and soul of each
of us. The joys of accomplishment in so many different ways help us
to feel good about ourselves and give us self-worth. The joys of
uplifting music, a spectacular sunrise or sunset, and (for me) a
glimpse at the stars above seem to help us reach higher toward "the
beyond."</P>

<P>But what I've noticed is that these present types of joy are
sometimes overshadowed or influenced by the second type -- the joys
of the past. It seems to me that a great number of times when I
think, "Wow, I feel joyful," my thoughts are somehow attached to the
past. Much of the joy of holidays, for example, is the joy of
remembering my past, for past joyous times I've experienced on the
holiday and for cherished holiday traditions. The joy of holidays
also has a lot to do with the heritage of the celebrated day. New
Year's Day gives me joy, yes partly because of new beginnings, but
also because of it's marking of a year gone by and the natural
tendency to think of what has gone on in the past year, both for me
as an individual and for the various communities I am a part of.
Easter reminds me of God's promises, but it also reminds me to think
back to what it was like in Jerusalem at the beginning of the current
age. Thanksgiving is about being thankful now, but that thankfulness
often stems from joys experienced in the past. Christmas is about
enjoying friends and family (and yes gifts), but it is also about
remembering past Christmas holiday cheer and about remembering that
first Christmas. Even birthdays remind me of the joys of the
past.</P>

<P>In some ways, it seems as though the present reminds us of the
past (our individual past), the past reminds us of the distant past
(the collective past or our "heritage"), the distant past reminds us
of the timeless, transcendent things, and it is ultimately these
transcendent things that take our breath away with the truest sense
of joy, the joy in spite of where we are, who we are, who we aren't,
where we have been, what shape we are in, or where we are heading on
earth.</P>

<P>So an interesting question: what is the root of joy? Is it the
past? or the present? I'm not sure. I think it is a strange mixture
of both. In some happy way, perhaps this is the way that joy renews
itself in our lives. We are joyful often when we remember the past
(even if the past itself was not always joyful). But as we go through
our lives, we experience many many things, some of which bring joy
immediately, and some of which require time and distance to provide
joy (and some that never end up giving joy). So our experiences do us
well in two ways -- immediate joy and remembered joy. Perhaps it is
this fact that gives us the treasured ability to "bounce back" from
utterly joyless times in life (which we all have had). Perhaps it is
God's blessed gift of the past that helps us to set our sights once
again on the joyful things in life, rather than the things that do
not produce joy.</P>

<P>I think on this Thanksgiving day I am thankful for joy in all it's
curious attributes. I am thankful even for the strange ways in which
life seems to work, and how the present seems inseparably bound to
the past. I believe that life truly is a web we weave, and we are in
some large sense a product of our past. The past is not always a
happy memory, of course, but somehow I've seen that God finds ways of
"turning our memories into gold" as they say, both happy memories and
sad ones. I've seen that God finds ways of turning our lives toward
joy, sometimes in the most unexpected ways.</P>

<P>I hope that as you go through life you will have much to be
thankful for and joyful about, both in the future, the present, and
in the golden memories of the past.</P>
