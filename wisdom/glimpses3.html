<P>So, here's some life detail information for you. My dad went in
for a physical a few weeks ago, and that led to 1) a stricter diet to
try to lower blood sugar and blood pressure and cholesterol (all of
which were borderline high), and 2)&nbsp;a colonoscopy. The
colonoscopy in turn led to the finding of six polyps, one of which
they found cancer cells in. So, yesterday was the consultation with
the surgeon, and of course their only advice was, "get that bad part
of your colon out ASAP."</P>

<P>Whew. That's a lot of stuff to think about. And yet, I&nbsp;feel
(once again)&nbsp;like I've been oblivious to it to some extent. I go
on about my life, doing what I do, with these problems in the back of
my mind. I&nbsp;have my whoah moments (see the previous entry), but
for whatever reason it seems like sometimes I don't take them
seriously enough. &#91; What's wrong with me? &#93; Maybe it's my own
special form of denial?</P>

<P>So now my dad needs to decide whether to have the surgery or not.
Of course the price is astronomical. And of course that shouldn't
matter. And to an extent, the discussion of late hasn't just been
about cost. It's been about "life," and more accurately how negative
it is. Negativity all over the place! And I understand where he's
coming from (I would probably be negative too in his place). But I
get tired of it. I mean, I&nbsp;don't understand how he or anyone
else can go on without some ray of hope. Now, I'm sure somewhere
inside he does have a ray of hope -- I think we all have to have some
ray of hope just to get through the day -- and I tried to get him to
think about that. I'm not sure if I got my point across or not.</P>

<P>Another thing is that my dad's "people net" (the people he gains
support and joy from) is very small. So... in contrast if I&nbsp;had
issues in life, I&nbsp;could find a pretty large number of people
that I could seek out for advice or (more likely) comfort. But with
such a small net, it just leads to loneliness (or a few people
getting dumped on, which is sorta the case here, but not to an
extreme, at least not yet). It's not a nice state to be in. So, word
of advice, don't isolate yourself from other people.</P>

<P>And, finally, I'll ask an annoying question, "Where is God in all
of this?" I ponder about God and think about Him and my relationship
with Him and His activity in the world and His presence in my life
and all that, but, given a situation that arises, all the pondering
in the world doesn't help much. All the logical reasoning seems cold
and not overly useful. I&nbsp;need to have all this stuff fixed in my
mind ahead of time so that I can enter trialful situations with some
assurance, not with a pile of questions of my own. But I don't have
my "ducks in order" in this respect. And, I can't speak for my dad,
but I'm guessing he has some unanswered God questions too. So, word
of advice, don't neglect seeking the presence of God now (whatever
state you're in), because someday, it will behoove you to know the
answers, rather than to be trying to find God in the middle of a
mess.</P>

<P>So, anyway, as for my title, I&nbsp;feel a little trapped. Trapped
in a house of negative thinking. And I don't like that. I feel my
youthful idealism slipping away, because of this stuff going on and
life in general. I maintain my hope, but that gets harder when I
watch my elders living, so it would seem, in spite of hope (who am
I&nbsp;to judge his heart, I know). And of course we are both (we are
all) trapped in bodies that work fine, and then sooner or later don't
work fine anymore. And we are trapped in a world where there are a
LOT&nbsp;of questions about God's will and how God works and if God
heals and when God heals and a million other things. And we are
trapped in a system of healthcare that is very good, but very
expensive, and without guarantees of being "good enough." We are
trapped in lives where we are told, "Eat lots of fiber, get lots of
exercise, eat your vegetables, etc etc" but there are no guarantees
that such measures will really produce in us a life full of years
without physical pain and anguish.</P>

<P>And there you have it. A pretty nice little snippet of my life
behind the computer screen at the moment. I'm probably not as
"depressed" about it as I sound. But the negative attitudes rub off
on me I&nbsp;suppose. I want to think about life in joyful terms, and
think about God as that close, intimate Creator, and think about my
body as being as good and reliable as I&nbsp;make it (with diet and
exercise), but neither of those things are always for certain. Bleh.
Such is life.</P>
