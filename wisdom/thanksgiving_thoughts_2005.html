<P>I'm not usually in the habit of just quoting other sources in my
wise thoughts archive, but this one is worth it. I saw it in a recent
bulletin from Grace Brethren Church here in CR. Please forgive the
resemblance to an email forward. It gives a lot of interesting
statistics -- things that we should be thankful for, and maybe things
that we should try to do something about.</P>

         <P>If you woke up this morning with more health than
         illness, you are more blessed than the million who won't
         survive the week.</P>
         
         <P>If you have never experienced the danger of battle, the
         loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture or the
         pangs of starvation, you are ahead of 20 million people
         around the world.</P>
         
         <P>If you attend a church meeting without fear of
         harassment, arrest, torture, or death, you are more blessed
         than almost three billion people in the world.</P>
         
         <P>If you have food in your refrigerator, clothes on your
         back, a roof over your head and a place to sleep, you are
         richer than 75% of this world.</P>
         
         <P>If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare
         change in a dish someplace, you are among the top 8% of the
         world's wealthy.</P>
         
         <P>If your parents are still married and alive, you are very
         rare, especially in the United States.</P>
         
         <P>If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and
         are truly thankful, you are blessed because the majority
         can, but most do not. If you can hold someone's hand, hug
         them or even touch them on the shoulder, you are blessed
         because you can offer God's healing touch.</P>
         
         <P>If you can read this message, you are more blessed than
         over two billion people in the world that cannot read
         anything at all.</P>
         
         <P>You are so blessed in ways you may never even know.</P>
         
         <P>This blessing will only keep working if it is
         continuously passed around. If you are a recipient of a
         blessing, keep the blessing working by being the source of
         blessing to other people.</P>
