<P><I>*Happy Sigh* Family camp. The time of sharing life with
friends; the time of getting away from it all for a few days; the
time of seeing church members in a new light; the time of talking
with church folks about more than sports; the time for walking on
trails and admiring God's beauty through creation; the time for doing
fun things with fun people. Basically, a happy time. :-) Family Camp
this year was last weekend, and I've spent a few hours transposing my
logs and thoughts here, so that I can share my experiences, my joys,
and my attitude adjustments with you all. God bless you as you read
this most exciting tale. Oh yeah. :-)</I></P>

<P><B><I>Thursday, July 19, 2001</I></B></P>

<P>I took a day and a half off of work and headed up to the
campground on Thursday afternoon, July 19th. I arrived at the camp at
about 3:30 pm, and played Ratkiller with the Berchenbriter girls for
an hour or so. That was quite a fun introduction to life at camp.
:-)</P>

<P>After that, I went and registered at the Snack Shack. Then it was
time for dinner, and after that I walked along the Fox Trail (and
walked back with Tim and one of the Berchenbriter twins).</P>

<P>Before the evening service, I was called up to the sound booth,
with the idea of watching Pastor&nbsp;Kory that night so I could take
over for him when he left on Friday. I was planning to be gone
picking up Heather on Friday night, but I volunteered my time for
Saturday night and Sunday morning.</P>

<P>The camp speaker was D. (Dave?) Clardie from Illinois
(I&nbsp;think). He spoke in the evening sessions and in at least one
of the three-per-day morning seminars in the tabernacle. Here are
some notes from the evening service Thursday night:</P>

<P>- clean laughter is a good thing<BR>
- story about witnessing to Eric Clapton<BR>
- Acts 9:26 -- coming face to face with the Holy Spirit<BR>
- spiritual provision on Straight Street<BR>
- let God do the changes (no judging) -- Ananias said "Brother Saul"
before Saul became Paul<BR>
- Acts 9:10-18 -- baptism<BR>
- Holy Spirit having me rather than me having the Holy Spirit<BR>
- "worldly pleasure"<BR>
- Gal. 2:20 -- Satan can't kill us because we're already dead<BR>
- Paul had all of God and God had all of him<BR>
- 2 Timothy 4:6-8<BR>
- Acts 9:26 -- burn for the glory of God</P>

<P>After the evening service I stayed at the tabernacle to watch the
afterglow movie "The Road to Redemption." This is a Billy
Graham-sponsored movie about a woman who through some connections
with the mafia owes $250,000. In order to get the money, she tries to
restore a long-neglected relationship with her grandfather, who is
wealthy, but is in a care center because of a heart condition. He
agrees to give her the money if she'll take him fishing. She agrees,
and they embark on a multiple-state journey in the woman's VW Beetle.
Eventually the two are left without transportation or supplies, but
through a few unexpected turns of events (Christian motorcycle
riders, etc), they eventually get to carry out their fishing date.
Throughout the course of the movie, the woman's heart is slowly
changed as she grows closer to her God-fearing grandfather and
especially as she almost loses him to a flare-up of his heart
condition.</P>

<P>During the movie I sat by Sandy Merritt and her kids, and for a
while Amy Lehman and her kids. This was a good experience, as it was
a chance to share a little time with church folks in a setting other
than a church service or a formal church gathering of some sort. And
besides, one of the Lehman toddlers enjoyed standing by my knee (how
cute).. :-)</P>

<P>I spent a little time after the movie at the campsite (I stayed in
my car Thursday night, parked near Sam's camping area, although Sam
didn't arrive until Friday evening). I went to bed a little after
midnight.</P>

<P><B><I>Friday, July 20, 2001</I></B></P>

<P>Friday morning I woke up about 8:00, and then read my Bible some
in the car before the morning seminars.</P>

<P>The morning seminars were held at the Tabenacle (on the tables in
back). The first was a game/message from the camp speaker D. Clardie,
the second was a testimony / life story from District Superintendent
R. McClung. The third seminar was a talk by the new camp manager Jeff
Robbins (also the new pastor at Faith Wesleyan in Cedar Falls). Jeff
talked about Ezekiel 37 (dry bones). Some memorable comments are
"every member a minister; every minister a servant," and "happy
members == productive members"</P>

<P>The seminars went until noon, and then it was lunchtime. After
lunch, I walked along the trail that follows the river east(?) of the
soccer field (a rarely-used trail, I think). Then, at 1:55 or so, I
left in the car for Minneapolis to pick up Heather. I had tried to
some extent to arrange a ride for Heather, but nothing presented
itself, so I went to pick her up. The trip up was an all-right one.
It rained at least half of the way up, but not heavily, so it wasn't
bad. I was thinking that it would take about two hours to go from
Floyd to Minneapolis, but in the end it took closer to three,
considering that I took 35W, the long way to Guidant, and there was a
good deal of rush hour traffic in Minneapolis at 4:30 p.m. on a
Friday. But I made it to Guidant at about 5:15 (after only one major
wrong turn, finding myself on the southbound road near Guidant,
instead of the northbound, which is the one I needed); after arriving
I had a nice chat with the guard, and picked up Heather.</P>

<P>We started back to camp quickly and stopped only once -- at the TA
in Albert Lea -- we ate at the McDonalds there. From there it was
straight back to camp, except for a stop at the quaint new gas
station in Floyd (with their gas price of $1.289/gallon). We got back
to camp a little before 9:00 (just missing the evening service). Our
first priorities were finding Heather a place to stay, and getting
her registered. Heather ended up staying in the car while I stayed in
Sam's large tent with Matthew -- so it worked out all right, I
think.</P>

<P>After settling in and registration, Heather and I went to the
soccer field -- this was about 10 PM&nbsp;and strangely enough it was
still sort of light out, and the combination of that and the thick
haze made stargazing difficult. Heather wanted to get to sleep too,
so we went back to the campsite and Heather went to sleep. I stayed
up a little and talked with the the Sam fam for a bit, and went to
bed at about midnight.</P>

<P><B><I>Saturday, July 21, 2001</I></B></P>

<P>Saturday morning I got up at 7:45 a.m. I then ate breakfast at the
campsite (just a couple granola bars). It was at breakfast that I
first got a chance to ride in Rob Braden's new(used) Jeep (oh the
funness of open-top cars), and heard about Tom's car issues (which
involved missing a turn, running over a curb, bending the wheel rim,
and having to leave the car in Charles City until Monday or
later).</P>

<P>Then Heather and I headed off to the morning seminars. The first
was another game/talk with the camp speaker -- a talk on Psalm 145.
After the first hour, Heather was restless and wanted to enjoy the
happy outdoor weather, so we walked around for the next couple of
hours -- walking to the campsite, the spring, the soccer trail, the
river, and the fox trail (basically the grand tour of Cedar Springs
outdoor attractions). We spent the most time at the river, skipping
stones and fun stuff like that (neither of us fell in, thankfully).
We also followed the fox trail further than usual -- past the rope,
to the point where the trail basically ceases to be a trail, thanks
to Heather, the explorer with the safari Guidant hat.</P>

<P>Then it was lunchtime, and after that Heather and I went walking
again. We were passing through the apple orchard on our way to the
baptism at the spring when we saw two deer. They were less frightened
than we expected, and they stayed fairly close by for 15-20 minutes,
at one time getting as close as 30 feet away. Eventually the cars on
the nearby road scared them into the cornfield (amazing how they can
avoid the barbed wire), and we went on our way. The baptism was a
good time, with about 5 people being baptised, mostly 5-15 year olds.
One woman was also baptized -- a woman who was from the Minneapolis
area and stayed in the camper next to Sam's.</P>

<P>After the baptism we came back to the campsite because for a while
it looked like rain (but it didn't really rain much that afternoon).
This was the beginning of what we might call The Badminton Issue.
Heather &amp; I played badminton for awhile at the campsite, but we
were finally hindered when our one birdie got stuck in the tree. We
had a frisbee with us, and tried to use the frisbee to get the birdie
out. After a few throws the frisbee also got stuck in the tree. It
was then that the camper neighbors donated some horseshoes to the
cause, and managed to get three of them stuck in the tree at one
point. Then Sam joined in the fun with a football, but it got stuck
too. Finally, Sam had a four foot (or so) tent pole that he threw
into the tree -- and it got stuck on the first throw. Now it wasn't
as though we had all of this stuff in the tree at once, but things
were constantly getting stuck in or falling out of the tree. Finally,
after maybe 15 minutes we managed to get all the stuff out of the
tree. We decided to put the badminton game away then. Soon after one
of the camp workers came by with a step ladder to help, but we were
already done. I'm not sure how much good the short ladder would have
done anyway though; I suggested we could have used it as a battering
ram -- as in throwing the whole ladder into the tree and trying to
get the other stuff out that way. Thankfully we didn't need to do
that.</P>

<P>After that event we played cards for a while (Ratkiller, of
course). As usual, we went back and forth exchanging cards for quite
a while, but just before I lost it was time to go help the music team
set up the PowerPoint slides and such, so we postponed the end of the
game.</P>

<P>Music practice was a fun time. Heather and I got to be in our
natural environment (computers, of course), and got to mess with the
computer that was annoying because you couldn't type more than a
sentence or two before it would act as if you'd pressed the up arrow
-- very annoying, especially when you're trying to transpose a whole
song quickly (just ask Heather). &#91;Someone at work says that
Compaq trackpads are known for such issues.&#93;</P>

<P>After practice, we finished our card game (it took me about 30
seconds to lose). Then we walked down by the river and along the fox
trail again, where we found Sam working on the trail. Then we walked
back to the fox trail entrance with Sam and then went to dinner.</P>

<P>The evening service was our first experience of being in charge of
the PowerPoint slides in front of lots of people. Heather got to be
the official space-bar pusher to advance the slides. A fun time.</P>

<P>Here are some notes from the evening service message:</P>

<P>- 1 Thess. 3 is all about faith -- leads to holiness<BR>
- Heb 11 -- by faith<BR>
**1: God wants to give me faith (1 Thess. 3:2)<BR>
- Eph 2:8-9; 1 Cor 3:11; Luke 19:10 -- LA street corner, etc.<BR>
**2: God wants to examine my faith (1 Thess. 3:5)<BR>
- 1 Cor 13:5; Luke 17:5<BR>
- the devil sets the fire and then makes us blame each other for
it<BR>
- 1 Peter 5:8 -- seeking to devour; we need to recognize and resist
the enemy<BR>
**3: God sends help for my faith (1 Thess 3:6)<BR>
- God is still on the throne<BR>
- "gift" of discipline and correction<BR>
- better to have the gift of encouragement<BR>
**4: God uses my faith (1 Thess 3:7)<BR>
- to help others<BR>
- God still works miracles<BR>
- for many problems we *cannot* do anything -- our faith *has* to
work<BR>
**5: God wants to increase my faith (1 Thess 3:10)<BR>
- Romans 10:17<BR>
- don't limit God (with lack of faith)<BR>
- drink as deep as you want to drink<BR>
- **God is still on the throne**<BR>
</P>

<P>After the service there was a reception for the Rittgers, who are
going to be moving to Emily Minnesota where Gary has bought a
hardware store. This was a weekend of transition of sorts, since
Rittgers' were leaving as camp managers and the Robbins' were just
starting.</P>

<P>At the end of this reception I think I maybe was stressing
Heather's patience (not to mention my own) trying to figure out what
to do about finding Heather a ride home on Sunday afternoon. From the
outset, I had intended to find someone from Minneapolis to take her
back, but I hadn't found anyone yet, and I was getting tired of
asking, and for whatever reason I was slowly forming the thought in
my mind that I was "supposed" to take her back myself (call it an
unction from God, or not, I'm not sure what it was). So I waited a
long time to ask Gary about it, and I finally decided not to ask,
thinking that *if* God wanted to find a ride for her besides myself,
it was up to Him. This caused me a theological issue, because I
couldn't figure out where the line was between "Trust God" and "God
gives you a brain" -- In one sense I feel like if I don't make things
happen, then nothing happens; on the other hand, trying to make my
way happen doesn't always leave room for God to move. So sometime
during the sermon or shortly afterwards I committed myself to the
second trip to Minneapolis barring God's further work, and I didn't
ask anyone else about it.</P>

<P>So anyway, after the reception, Heather and I went out to the
soccer field again and watched stars from the picnic table. We
formulated a theory, which states, "Stargazing is an excuse to talk"
-- one of those "wow" statements that I think is really true. We
talked about a lot of things (mostly I listened, but that was okay).
It was an inspiring time for me, I think, since it was one of the
very few one-on-one, in person, substantive conversations I've had
with someone my age this summer. (Happy Joe) After awhile, some other
folks drove to the soccer field as well (Rob, Tom, etc), and we left
when the added talking became distracting. We ended up out by the
orchard again, where we talked some more abut life and other such fun
topics. Then we went to sleep in the car and the tent (same as last
night), at about midnight.</P>

<P>While I was waiting for sleep to take hold of me, I was thinking
some random thoughts, which I later wrote down. My unfinished words
of art were something like this: "Memories come like tye-dyed paint
on an upright canvas: smeared, blurred, and quickly dripping;
non-distinct, yet distinctly powerful..." That's as far as my
thoughts took me.</P>

<P><B><I>Sunday, July 22, 2001</I></B></P>

<P>Sunday morning I woke up about 7:40, and proceeded to eat
breakfast at the campsite. During breakfast, we learned of Sam's
trials -- you'll remember he had worked on the fox trail for a couple
hours on Saturday, and probably had not given his body enough time to
heal from a previous pinched nerve sort of problem. So he was
suffering on Sunday morning, and later Sharon took him in to the
doctor, who gave him a pain shot and some medication and told him to
take it easy.</P>

<P>At 8:30 Heather and I made our way to the tabernacle sound booth
once again to take the reigns of the fun computer and PowerPoint. The
music team practiced for about an hour, and then there was a special
video at 9:30 -- a farewell to Pastor Joe &amp;&nbsp;Della Mott,
leaders of the Family Hour, a show on TV in Austin Minnesota...the
final episode was hosted by Pastor Randy Peterson, the current pastor
in Austin.</P>

<P>Here are some notes from the Sunday morning service (D.
Clardie):<BR>
- 1 John 4:4 &amp;&nbsp;5:4 -- greater is He that is in me<BR>
- **Victory**&nbsp;and how to gain it<BR>
- you're never more vulnerable to defeat than immediately following a
victory<BR>
- Ps. 34<BR>
- all people get trapped in a "rinse cycle" sometimes (trials)<BR>
***A. victory comes when I accept (receive) the Lord (Ps 34:8)<BR>
- Ps. 34:18,22 -- God is a refuge; Romans 8:1<BR>
- the need of the heart is the same for the music star and the
prostitute<BR>
***B. victory comes when I commit my fears to the Lord<BR>
- 1) trace your fears (perfect love casts out fear)<BR>
- 2) face your fear (Is 41:10)<BR>
- 3) place your fear (on Jesus)<BR>
- 4) space your fear (Matt 6:33-34)<BR>
- Ps. 34:4 -- deliverance from fear<BR>
***C. victory comes when I call out to the Lord<BR>
- seeking the voice of God<BR>
- God never mistakes our voice<BR>
- Hebrews -- angels are ministering spirits</P>

<P>The morning service was over at about 11:30, and we left camp soon
after that, perhaps 11:45 or 12:00. We saw some "cool" clouds between
Floyd and Mason City (storm clouds), and had some rain to go along
with them. We drove through and stopped in Albert Lea again, this
time stopping to go through the drive thru at Burger King (west of
I-35). The rest of the trip to Minneapolis was fairly uneventful.
When we got into the Minneapolis area, there wasn't the rush hour
traffic that there had been on Friday night, but that almost made it
worse, since cars were trying to merge onto the road at 55 MPH
instead of 10 MPH. I&nbsp;had an issue when 4 cars tried to merge as
I was going by, and I couldn't switch lanes. They all got in somehow,
but I'm sure they weren't all real happy. Then when I pulled into
Heather's apartment parking lot, I was rushing to beat the door from
closing on me, so I had a little side-mirror issue -- you know, when
you get a little too close to the side and scrape your mirror. I was
glad it didn't knock the mirror off completely.</P>

<P>I took a short break at Heather's place, and then was off again on
my way back to good old Cedar Rapids. One of the fun things on the
way home was seeing Brian (from work) and his wife as they passed me
in their car near Manly...I assume they were heading back from their
parents' homes in Hutchinson, MN. I stopped in Floyd for gas, and
continued on. As I neared Urbana, I saw that a storm was ahead. As I
drove further on, I found myself in the middle of the storm; some
folks stopped along the side of the road; I kept driving, but at a
slower pace, since I could barely see the road through the rain. It's
always fun driving through thunderstorms. :-) But I made it, and
finally reached home at 7:32 p.m. on Sunday night.</P>

<P><B><I>Post-Camp Reflections</I></B></P>

<P>Well if you've read this far, you must really be interested in my
life, and therefore my thoughts. I obviously enjoyed the weekend
spent at camp, and even though it's a week later now, I think it has
had some impact on my everyday life. I'll try and give an accurate
portrayal...</P>

<P>First of all, there was the issue of travel. As I was planning
this trip, I was hoping to not have to travel to Minneapolis. I sent
email to some of the churches in Minneapolis about two weeks before I
left, and didn't get a response. About a week before camp, I called
several churches, and again didn't receive a response until it was
too late. So I resigned myself to traveling to Minneapolis on Friday
afternoon to pick Heather up. While at camp, I asked a few people
about taking Heather back on Sunday, but no one really offered a
ride. Eventually, I got tired of asking. I wasn't going to let this
issue be a distraction from the weekend activities. Saturday night, I
was frustrated about the state of matters, but during the service on
Saturday night, I made up my mind (more or less) to take Heather back
on Sunday, unless someone offered a ride based on my previous
asking.</P>

<P>The strange part of all this is how my thoughts changed over time,
and how several things seemed to work together to bring about this
result. First of all, on Thursday before I left for camp I wanted to
check my email to see if Heather or Maya had any leads on a ride, but
I couldn't because Iowa State's mail server was under attack by a
virus -- quite the unusual event. Then, while at camp, I slowly
realized that it was going to be hard to find a ride for Heather. At
first I was upset, like I said, but eventually I got used to the
idea. She commented once on Saturday that she had some issues with
riding with people she didn't know (something I had wondered about),
so that gave me more incentive to drive her back. Finally, by Sunday,
I was almost wanting to make the trip, and almost hoping that no one
would try to change my mind. I don't know if it was not wanting to
let the weekend end, or just not wanting to have to change my plans
again, or truly God's will, but whatever the case, I felt "God's
peace" about it.</P>

<P>As I mentioned before, there is a theological issue here in trying
to call this an "act of God". On the one hand, when trying to find
God's will, we are called to wait upon God and for his direction and
leading...supposedly we should just be patient, or "be still and know
I am God". On the other hand, many are quick to point out that God
also gave us a brain, and so for us to be completely inactive may
just be our laziness -- and God may not rescue us if we do not make
the effort that we can. There is a fine line here, and for me it was
a problem (like it always is). Do I look for a ride, or let God
decide? Always a hard question. Faith tells me I should let God
decide. But my biased view of life and experience tells me that if I
don't act, nothing will change. This is probably a bad attitude, but
it is my perception most of the time.</P>

<P>Well if you haven't noticed , the weekend was obviously a "Heather
weekend". I think this was something I needed -- one on one contact
with a trusted friend, someone I could "be myself"&nbsp;around with
all my dumb jokes and stuff. Before camp, I&nbsp;had been on a sort
of downward turn, with the typicalness of life in CR and work and
computer stuff and all the usual stuff. I had noticed my own lack of
patience with some people, which bothered me. During the weekend, I
think I was reminded of some of my higher-minded thoughts of a few
months ago, a reminder that helped me regain a more correct and
satisfying perspective on life. For example, this spring and summer
has, to some extent, been a time of trying to keep in touch with
people who apparently don't want to keep in touch. There have only
been a few people like this, but those few have impacted my thinking,
drawing me down into the once-familiar thoughts of "people are dumb"
and other such evil thoughts. Since sharing the hours with friends
and fellow Christians, my mind has been "softened" once more --
blessed with renewed hope, and, again, a new perspective. I truly
thank God for the opportunity, for the time spent, for the messages
heard, and for the safety we had while traveling.</P>

<P>One other topic that came up at least twice was passion. I think
there are a lot of terms -- hope, faith, passion, "life" in that
"life"ful way -- that all relate to similar ideas. Passion is
something we all need, but often find hard to grasp, because it's not
something we can purchase or wish into existence. It can only come
from God, ultimately, and often it takes the cooperation of us all
sometimes to share the passion with one another, and one of the goals
of time spent with friends, I believe, is to encourage the godly
kinds of passion and hope and faith that we all need help to realize.
I'm tempted to say that happy phrase "love with skin on", but that
particular phrase wasn't a highlight of my thought life this weekend,
so I'll just leave it at that and let you draw the parallel if your
mind chooses to do so.</P>

<P>Finally, I want to leave you with a reminder of the new phrase
coined at camp: "Stargazing is an excuse to talk." If you know me,
you know that I talk about stargazing a lot, along with sunrises,
sunsets, watching hot air balloons etc. All of these activities in
one way or another are my wishful thinking about spending time with
people in a unique and special way. I've noticed this summer that
conversation is often not very satisfying if it's not one-on-one. For
me at least, often I find myself squelched out of conversation simply
because I don't think "on my feet" as fast as some others, or I don't
share the same interests. Perhaps the biggest issue though is that
it's a whole lot easier to delve into "deep" subjects one-on-one,
because in group conversation the topic seems to change quite often.
Sometimes one-on-one conversations are that way as well, but there
seems to be more of a chance to steer the conversation back on the
subject.</P>

<P>Well, I don't know if my thoughts are profoundly coherent tonight.
I have an idea of what has changed, and what the weekend has meant to
me, and I think I've done a fair job of relating that to you...but,
like usual, there always seems to be more to tell, because I'm
longwinded. But nothing comes to mind right now, so I'll sign off.
Just remember, go stargazing with your friends, not just to watch
stars, but to make memories, and to share the thoughts and attitudes
that the normal pace of life will not allow. And when you socialize
with your friends, take a deep breath, enjoy it, and remember it,
because you will probably realize (like me) that those are the best
times in life. Amen.</P>
