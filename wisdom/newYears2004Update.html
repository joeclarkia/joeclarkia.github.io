<P>Well, it's been about 3 weeks now since my new year's resolutions
went into effect. I have struggled with them, and overall my
thoroughness in reaching them has not been very impressive. This
fact, as well as life in general today (no specific reason -- just
thoughts on my mind), prompt me to write about resolutions and
life...</P>

<P>First off, I'll go through my resolutions and comment on the
progress toward each one.</P>

<P>1) Communing with the outdoors at least three hours per week:
Well, seeing as New Year's in Iowa ushers in some of the coldest
weather of the year, this is more difficult than I thought. That's my
excuse for now at least. I almost immediately decided to broaden my
horizons on this issue. Now, instead of including only things
outside, I also include social events and
other...informal...occasions. Basically, it is becoming a resolution
to allow myself to relax once in a while and not always be working on
some task. Even with this in mind, it's hard to find the three hours
of what I would call socializing or relaxation some weeks (stupid
workaholism). So, my overall 3-week grade in this area is...C.</P>

<P>2) Marginalism. Righhhtttt. Before the holidays, I was getting up
around 7:15 or so, which was a little later than I would have liked.
So my goal in marginalizing turned out to be mainly about getting up
earlier so I would have more time to "glide through life" to get to
work, rather than rush around so much. (Marginalizing is a bigger
topic than just getting up early, but getting up early is the best
example&nbsp;I&nbsp;can think of.) The first week after break, my
average time of getting up was probably 7:20 or 7:25 -- LESS margin
rather than more. So, I give myself a D in this category.</P>

<P>3)&nbsp;Lose weight: Well, shortly after the beginning of the year
I went and had a physical, so it was good in that regard to have a
regular basic checkup. He suggested some things to keep in mind while
trying to lose weight. Then, a week or so later I ordered a "body fat
monitor" scale, which is another way to keep good measurements of
healthiness. But, as is often my problem, I&nbsp;have been fairly
good about recording data, but have not been nearly so good about
taking the steps necessary to make the data *change* (eg, exercise
and eating more healthily). I am thinking about it more, but so far
my weight hasn't really changed and my attitude sadly hasn't much
either. Grade: D.</P>

<P>4) Although not stated on the same wise thought page (but the
focus of the next one after the new year's one), my 4th goal has been
to seek out a girlfriend this year, and/or to think much more deeply
about why I don't work harder at getting a girlfriend. Surprisingly
enough, I think this is my most successful resolution so far.
I&nbsp;have put some thought into it, and I will get into my results
below. Grade for now: B.</P>

<P>Now, that's the executive summary. Here are some thoughts inspired
by the past day or two at work or the past week or month or my life
as it seems:</P>

<P>* One of the areas of marginalism that I take for granted is the
amount of time I spend at work. I'm a workaholic!! Bad me! I need to
practice leaving work earlier -- 8 hours instead of 10 or 11. Working
is fun, and it's good to gain experience, but work should not be 90%
of my entire life. I cannot solve all the world's (or one project's)
problems, and most things can wait till tomorrow. Someday I&nbsp;hope
to learn this lesson.</P>

<P>* Several people have mentioned to me that I should join an
e-dating service. I have really been analyzing (okay, at least today
I&nbsp;have) what my thoughts are on that idea. For whatever reason,
I am resistant to an e-dating service. If it were just randomly
instant messaging people, that would be fun, and if that developed
into romance, well, great. And if one of my friends set me up on a
blind date...it would be an adventure, something I would look forward
to. But e-dating just seems too much like...a copout, I guess...to
me. Part of it is the money (I can't find anyone, so I'll pay someone
else to help). Part of it is the lack of adventure ("I can't find
anyone so I'll let someone else do all the hard work for me"). Part
of it is that people around me, good or bad, always seem more
reachable than the people I don't even know -- kinda like the sending
offerings to Africa principle -- I can donate money to worldwide
charities, but I can't (or don't)&nbsp;*really* connect with them as
well as with a local charity. In the same way, it's hard for me to be
excited about meeting random people that I don't know at all.
Finally, e-dating seems (bad me)&nbsp;a little like saying, "I'm
desperate to find someone, so I'll ask for help." While I may think
I'm desparate sometimes, my, uh, pride convinces me that I'm not
really desparate -- at least not desparate enough to leave this part
of life up to someone else. "I can find my own girlfriend thank you"
-- even when I can't. My thoughts on this topic are ongoing, and I
really want to continue to focus some of my mental energy on this
topic.</P>

<P>* One thing that scares me is that I see the shadows of old
patterns in my mind. I&nbsp;am not currently really focusing on any
one person in particular as far as the infatuation game goes. But I
have had a heightened sensivity to it, partly with resolution#4 in
mind. And lately, as that focus has intensified just a bit (see my
wise thought from a couple nights ago about Valentine's Day), I sense
in my mind the beginnings of craziness. What I&nbsp;mean is that
normally, I am relatively stable. Outwardly, I am crazy complaining
or crazy singing or crazy silly, but those are covers for the logical
rational me that is fairly stable. However, when I choose to play the
infatuation game (which I always do it seems when anything close to
"dating" comes to mind), I head down a slippery slope. I have not
slid down the slope for a year or more, but I&nbsp;have just enough
of a glimpse of it at the moment to realize that in all my ... year
... of growing and maturing and all that hopeful stuff, I still have
the ice of the slope in my life. Recurring patterns like something
from the Twilight Zone. My "stability" double-crosses me by chaining
me to the unstable patterns in my life that I would love to be rid
of. I would love to have a "normal" dating life (whatever that
means), but I always draw conclusions where they are not warranted,
and it just drives situations to stupidity. I need to get a handle on
that and control my emotions and all, but I don't know how, except
through painful experience (and, due to the pattern, probably more
than just one or two). "God help me."</P>

<P>* I've also seen this three weeks that, still, I am addicted to
computers. I work with them, play on them, learn on them, write on
them, get mad at them, am impressed by them, grieve for them
(occasionally)....the full range of emotions it would seem. But what
I seem to fail to realize is that the Computer Life is not really
much of a life. It is knowledge and problem-solving, but not a lot of
meatiness. Really, I think that the best I can do with my computer
knowledge is earn a living to fund myself and others, and to help
others in their own computer issues, and (sometimes)&nbsp;allow
computers to be a tool for entertainment and relaxation. As I the
beautification engineer should know, life is about people and
relationships, not computers. I need to get out more and stop wasting
my life on computer topics all the time.</P>

<P>* I wrote an article a year or two ago about "steak
&amp;&nbsp;cheese"&nbsp;in my life, particularly at work. What
I&nbsp;meant then was that I am often cheesy (silly) at work, but I
am also steak-like (deep and rich in intellect). And at work I still
exercise my weirdness and silliness frequently. But, as time has gone
on the last several months, I think I've become more and more
complaint-oriented. I think people are coming to expect me to
complain about everything. And these complaints are not always
reasoned out arguments about a topic with a clear aim towards
bettering the situation. Some are just whining, and some are
beginning to hint at a hopeless, "Topic X is hopelessly messed up and
I&nbsp;hate it" attitude. None of this is very becoming of a
beautification engineer. And I need to do better. On the other hand,
the BE attitude can easily lead to the "complain about everything"
attitude because of the idealism inherent in BE-ing. If I have a
dream of the world I'd like to see, of the software I'd like to code,
of the hardware I'd like to use, of the person I'd like to be...well,
that dream world is most likely not reality, and if I'm not careful
living in the "real world" will cause me to grow bitter. I think I've
always been "bitter-sweet" aka idealistic, but bad for me if
I&nbsp;ever start turning into a cynic, a hopeless pessimist,
destroying what might be the very root of beautification engineering
(hope).</P>

<P>* I also want to comment on rejection. Resolution#4 tells me I
should ask people on dates. Why don't I? Cuz I'm stupid! In my life,
asking people such things has always been a lose-lose situation.
Usually they say no, which I'm told is normal, but it annoys me, and
it produces awkwardness. This is not made any easier by the fact for
me that I'd like to actually know someone before asking them out, but
dating your friends is a common recipe for having less friends in the
end. If anyone were to not say no, I'm afraid I would relive old
patterns (see above) and do something stupid to mess up the
situation, either thinking too far ahead or not thinking enough about
the future direction, or just not thinking at all. So, yes, I fear
rejection. But I also fear the lack of rejection, because it is a
foreign concept to me, and perhaps a situation that I've never truly
imagined myself in, because I've always been bitter about the
rejection. Resolution#4 is supposed to aid in this by helping me
think critically about the whole dating thing and where I&nbsp;want
it to take me and how to act while within and not within the
hypothetical dating relationship.</P>

<P>*&nbsp;I've noticed a slight undercurrent among those at work that
might best be phrased the search for doing *good*. Specifically at
work, it deals with creating a project that will truly meet our
goals, not just limp along well enough to make something that works
marginally well. In a broader sense, I&nbsp;have my days when I
wonder what amount of good I actually do. I&nbsp;write
programs...yippee. I go to church...joy. I&nbsp;help people with
their computers for hours on end (can we say being used...maybe). I
support charity. These are all okay things, but of what *good* are
they? This is I guess where the eternity word comes in again. And
with it comes the idea of people. Only people &amp;&nbsp;God are
eternal, and only eternal things really matter. Temporal things are
ok, and hey, we've got to pass the moments somehow, but I wonder how
often I get stuck thinking and doing things that are just stuff and
filler and the "packing foam" of life. I long to do what is truly
*good*&nbsp;and eternal and life-changing, but the combination of
suitable opportunities and my willingness to take advantage of them
is hard to come by.</P>

<P>* I am also getting my fill lately of corporate politics.
Documentation, money, "best practices", schedules, personalities,
distractions, bad decisions -- what a drain on productivity and
liveliness those are! I must be a technogeek, because while I enjoy
to some extent working on these items, they seem to get so
politically charged as to be completely stupid at times. At those
times, I don't really want to have any part of them, and that's when
I just go write software and get some real work done (and at other
times too of course). Grr...sometimes you have to stop all the
politics and just break out the compilers.</P>

<P>* One thing I've noticed about my resolutions the last three weeks
is that I have crafted a system whereby I&nbsp;can keep fairly good
track of my progress rather easily. I have purchased some tools (the
body fat monitor, a calendar, a pen, a light above my bed)&nbsp;to
make this documentation simple. So, in typical engineer fashion, I
have the tools to draw graphs and "see the progress." However, I am
much much more reluctant to MAKE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;PROGRESS! I can talk
about food all I want, and talk about fat, and talk about exercise,
and talk about being sedentary, and talk about getting up early, and
talk about being outside, and talk about girlfriends, until I can't
speak another word! But if I don't act on them, what good is it? If I
never resist a craving for food, if I&nbsp;never go for a walk, if
I&nbsp;never stop sitting behind a computer, if I never drag myself
out of bed before 7am, if I&nbsp;never do things outside, and if
I&nbsp;never ask people out on dates, how can I expect anything to
change? This is one of those patterns in my life I suppose. I can be
committed to a goal, and dream about the desired result, but I often
don't put in the hard work and hard decision making steps to meet the
goal. Big talk, little action. Hence the self-reprimanding name
"weak-willed fool".</P>

<P>* Another thing that I've been thinking about is the legacy that I
am building in my wise thoughts. I&nbsp;know I'm long-winded.
I&nbsp;know I write too much on these pages. I&nbsp;know that people
will rarely read all this stuff that I write. People say they enjoy
the topics, but do they really read them and "savor" them, or do they
just skim it to be nice? "Who will be enthralled with me and my
thoughts?" It's a question I've been asking for a long time.
I&nbsp;have no good answer. It's a lonely question, and a lonely lack
of answers. But, on the other hand, it's in the lonely moments that
I&nbsp;remember the quote from a book (I've mentioned it before)
where an old man dances on the beach saying, "The Father is very fond
of me." To be loved by the Creator Himself...my ultimate goal,
whether I realize it or not. I can entertain myself with the
realization (or hope) that God Himself enjoys reading these, even if
no one else has the time or the interest.</P>

<P>* Finally (finally!) in the midst of all these thoughts today, I
was contemplating soon being lost in the details of life. Life is not
crazy busy today, but in the next weeks it may be, with more travel
for work on the horizon, and some hard math to learn for the class
I'm taking, and other miscellaneous activities and things politely
demanding my attention. It seems unfair that while I'm thinking about
change and how hard it is, it is also those times when I am swept
down the stream of life by all the random things I need to be doing,
leaving little time to think about the higher ground on the timeless
shores along the stream of life, let alone time to actively struggle
to swim towards them.</P>

<P>* Final note: If you haven't noticed this is one of those whiny
self-deprecating wise thoughts. I think I'll blame it on not getting
quite as much sleep the last few nights as I should have. I hope you
can still see the beautification engineering (idealism, sunsets,
hope) in the midst of my whining and self examination. I&nbsp;hope
*I*&nbsp;can still see it for that matter. "This too shall pass." If
you choose to think a little less of me because of my thoughts and
self-disclosure, well, so be it. As Captain Picard said (with one or
two more colorful metaphors) "If we're going to be condemned, let's
be condemned for who we really are."</P>
