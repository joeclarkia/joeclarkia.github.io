<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>The purpose of this page is to record thoughts
about my productivity as an individual and as a member of the
engineering community. These thoughts are meant to inspire me and
remind me of some of the things that I am apt to forget at times.
These thoughts are online for everyone to see because -- well,
because almost all of my interesting thoughts are -- and because
someone else out there might benefit from these ruminations as
well.</I>

         frequently be the case that it is the one thing that you
         failed to plan for that is actually the thing that you
         should have planned for. In the interest of optimization,
         efficiency, and just not wasting your life, always try to
         plan for every possibility you can think of.</B></FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>It is surprising to me how easy it is
         to miss one key term and find that that one key term was the
         one that made all the difference. Never underestimate the
         power of a seemingly insignificant item to wreak havoc on an
         otherwise-well-thought-out project.</B></FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>It is surprising to me how hindsight
         really is 20/20. Before you are made aware of some certain
         fact, it just seems unknown. But when it is made clear, it
         seems crazily obvious, and in some strange way, it seems
         like you almost knew the fact before you were made aware of
         it, and it was only by some twist of mental inability that
         you didn't pay attention to it in time.</B></FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Pick your hobbies wisely. Computers
         are addictive. Duh. Linux, games, email, IM, etc. etc. They
         are powerful tools. But they can be overused too. I am
         highly adept at the art of wasting time on the computer. It
         doesn't *feel* like wasted time, but it often ends up being
         12:30am and I&nbsp;haven't REALLY accomplished anything on
         the computer for the evening. This is just stupid. Either do
         something useful on the computer, or find something else to
         do. Go ride a bike. Go read a book. Go (gasp) socialize with
         people. Just about anything to get out of the stupid rut of
         work, compute, sleep, work, compute sleep.</B></FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Defer your inventions. Don't run off
         and implement the Next Big Thing every other day. If you are
         doing it for yourself, it will be a fad and you will often
         only be wasting your own time. If you are doing it for
         someone else, make sure it's REALLY&nbsp;what they want
         before you spend time on it. If you have a great invention
         that no one uses, then, again, it's just a waste of time.
         Instead of wasting time on things that sound "cool", spend
         your valuable time on things that are
         "valuable."</B></FONT></P>
