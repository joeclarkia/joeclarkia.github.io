Dating and (the Illusion of) Friendship</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">People tell me that I have a big heart
and that I care about people. To me, that's a great compliment, but
it's also the cause of a lot of anxiety. You see, I seem to take my
friendships to extremes; I am rarely satisfied with the people around
me. I want deep, real friendship, but I am often either upset at what
they do to me, or I am upset about what I see them do to
others.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">It seems that most if not almost all
people in our society (since I'm a high school student, I'm thinking
mostly of teenagers, and since I'm a Christian, I look mostly at
those who are Christians or at least go to church) have become
heartless and cruel. It's not a matter of drugs, sex, alcohol, or any
of the physical factors. It's a matter of the heart, a state of mind.
When people become obsessed with sports, verbally assaulting
followers of an opposing team, or when people become hung up on
politics, caring more about their party than about being productive
and doing something meaningful, I think that our society is messed
up. These are only two examples. There are so many more that I
haven't mentioned and maybe haven't even thought of. Situations I
encounter, words I hear spoken, written words of pain - they all seem
to ring out to me the foolishness and "numbness" which characterizes
our society today.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">Let me explain numbness for a moment.
Over the past month or so, this has become one of my favorite words
(not favorite, exactly, but the most applicable). A slightly more
appropriate word might be apathy. No one seems to care about anything
anymore. It's not only a selfish attitude (although many are
selfish); it's just a non-concern about anything and everything, an
unwillingness to listen, an unwillingness to help, an unwillingness
to care, all of which lead to hopelessness, friendlessness,
fearfulness, timidity, and despair.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">Perhaps I'm just a little strange, but it
seems like there is an issue here that is tremendously difficult to
deal with, or really to even describe. It is the problem of faked,
misplaced, and insincere love, the problem of a lack of compassion,
the problem of a society lost in a maze of constant petty demands
which may be materially productive but are mentally only distractions
from finding any real purpose and meaning (translation: people are
too busy doing half-meaningful "things"). These are the ills of
society that are present, but everyone seems too apathetic - too numb
- to do anything about. Our society is one of paradoxes. We want
something, but can't have it. We want to help, but don't. We want to
feel love, but are too afraid or too uncaring to seek it. We want to
show and express love, but only to satisfy ourselves. We want things
to be better, but we really don't expect them to be. We want peace,
but never expect to find it. We want good, but often we want good at
the expense of others.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">This is our society, lost in chaos and so
distraught from nagging questions which the increase of knowledge has
dropped into our minds that we can't even think straight.</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">One effect of our lack of direction that
I see is the lack of real friendship. I believe that everyone wants
to have friends, and some think they've found them, and a few
probably have. But more often (in my experience, at least), I find
acquaintances, not friends. And as I've sought friendships with the
opposite sex, I have faced the ultimate question, "Are you seeking a
friend or a dating relationship?" Is there a difference? Surely there
must be. But the line seems blurred. If I speak to a girl, I am said
to be flirting. If I smile too much while I talk to a girl, I am said
to be "hitting on" her. What should I do? Not say anything, keep to
myself like the shy introvert I normally am? What do I have then?
Friends? No, I have only acquaintances.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">And then there are those who are
"friends" in theory - those who in the past have shown some kind of
interest in me, or those whom I've been able to share some experience
with and know a little bit better than most, whom I mistakenly label
as "friends." But these "friends" are really only acquaintances as
well. What does the word "friend" even entail? Time spent together?
Similar interests? Is there more? Time and similar interests make
good acquaintances, but NOT good friends. There must be more, some
"emotional bond," if you will. But as soon as emotions become
involved, we automatically think of girlfriend/boyfriend
relationships. Is there any way to find a friendship involving love
or compassion with the opposite sex without being seen as a
flirt?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">And so, our fractured society has one of
its supporting structures very noticeably absent. We have workplace
relationships (acquaintances). And we have couples (dating
relationships). But for everyone and everything in between, there is
a vacuum - a vacuum where there once was friendship, but now is
either a boring acquaintance or an expectation of romantic
involvement. Those lost within that vacuum are either bored or lonely
or both. And when this has gone on long enough, when we have all been
in that vacuum, we tend to say, "Who cares? Will anything I do ever
change anyone in any way? Can I ever really be happy? Will anyone
ever really care about me?" And thus we become numb, lose all sense
of hope and love, and become living manequins and zombies, going
through life without meaning, without expectation, without goals,
without life.</FONT></B></P>
