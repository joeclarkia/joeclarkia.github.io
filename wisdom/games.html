<P>Over the last month or so, I've been kind of surprised by the
number of people I've been able to meet or spend more time with than
in the past or just in general get to know better. It's been
refreshing, and also rather busy; it seems like I've spent less time
at home lately, and in a way I've spent less time "drinking lemonade
on the beach" metaphorically as I had talked about earlier in the
summer. Life gets busy, and the balance between alone time and
with-people time sometimes is hard to keep.</P>

<P>Now, because of the number of people and events I've been
partaking in lately, I guess I start to think about what the most fun
times have been, and what I like and don't like about "hanging out"
with people. Basically, given the choice, I would choose most other
activities over playing games. And let's be specific: by games I mean
board games, or card games, or other similar types of games. Even in
years past as a kid, I remember not being overly fond of games. I
play games, but usually it's not my first plan (I just play them to
go along with the crowd), and I'm rather picky about my games,
ranging from, "Yeah, that's a cool game, I just don't play it much",
to "I hate that game, it's too hard and makes me think too much."</P>

<P>There's something to be said for that last phrase. Sometimes I'm
amazed I did so well in the years of school, because sometimes I feel
pretty dumb. I think we all have our strong areas and weak areas, and
sometimes I think common sense or deductive reasoning is not one of
my strong skills. I&nbsp;mean, "troubleshooting" is a skill I
hopefully have learned by now, but that's not the same as the general
brain teasers you find in those MENSA&nbsp;quizzes -- and those are
the kind of teasers that are the basic components of a lot of games.
I SHOULD&nbsp;probably play more of these types of games to sharpen
my mind, but I have made a practice of focusing on other things, so I
just am out of practice and tend to be bad at them.</P>

<P>Now, besides the "I'm dumb" factor, there is also the "best use of
time" factor. I was driving home tonight, listening to the "Nature's
Chant"&nbsp;cassette when I caught a brief glance of a smokestack
with smoke coming out of it at a local factory. I had the flash of a
thought that in a way I'd literally rather watch the smokestacks than
play some games. Now, that's not as antisocial as it sounds. The
similar thought is that I'd rather go stargazing than play games. I
like spending time with people, but I guess I tend to look for
something deeper than just a board game. On the other hand, I know
that meeting new people is a balancing act, not to go too deep too
soon, and not to stay too aloof, so games are an easy casual
environment to get to know people. This is true, and is probably why
I'm willing to put up with my reservations and really try to defeat
my contrariness. But still...</P>

<P>So a temporary change of topic... I was reading about
contemplation tonight in a book by Thomas Merton, just the basics of
what contemplation is and what it isn't. There is something very
appealing about that line of thought; it goes along well with my (not
entirely successful)&nbsp;grasping at the eternal --
"contemplation"&nbsp;in its purest form is very close to that -- of
trying to view life and God and everything in its most "true" form,
to view them from, in a way, an eternal point of view. Something like
that.</P>

<P>While I was reading my contemplations at the empty Noelridge
softball diamonds, two hot air balloons passed close by overhead. How
cool is that? Always a way to make me contemplative. :-) In one
glimpse, I saw one of the balloons from behind the backstop, and then
as it floated by it became clear in my view after passing by the
backstop. Being in a contemplative mood, I was sure there was
symbolism in that, being able to fly, but still hindered, and then
freed from the "chains" and the hindrances...amazing little thought
when in the right mood. Later I caught one last glimpse of the
balloon and just had to say out loud, "AMEN" for no reason. Call me
weird. I was in a cute mood.</P>

<P>So anyway, those are the times of my life. Now, compare that with
playing games. I realize that games are a way of building
relationships, and (ideally) a way to just hang out and relax, but I
seem to drive myself towards "the beyond" in most things that I do. I
always want the beautiful and the deep and the meaningful and the
cute and the bubble hugs and the happy. I guess those types of things
tend to be more outdoorsy things, and tend to be more active things,
and tend to be more "intimate" things (for lack of a better word),
where intimate does not necessarily mean one-on-one, just very
"bondful". So, in a way games are a cheapeasy way to pass the time,
but usually there are, if I&nbsp;had my way, more bondful things to
do, both with the people involved and with the world (in the good
sense) and God. Like, tonight: if we had not been playing games, we
could have...oh...gone stargazing. I haven't done that much at all
this summer, and I kinda miss it. I need to call up RS and schedule a
stargazing session, since most people don't seem too interested in
things like that.</P>

<P>There is also the "hard working servant" attitude that I have just
a touch of. This attitude would see games as a waste of time compared
to the service we could do for God and the community. So, instead of
playing games we could be planning a trip to the local homeless
shelter, or something. I'm not as committed to this mindset as
perhaps I should be, but I have some element of it, and I think (and
hope) that as we focus more and more at church on community service
projects, I will see such use of time more and more as both a time to
bond with people and also a chance to do service. But on the other
hand, you can't serve full throttle all the time, and sometimes you
just need to play a game or two (or do something else relaxing)...so
this topic too has to be taken in moderation. As for relaxation, I'm
lazy, so I'd rather watch a movie than play a thinking game.</P>

<P>Okay, so those are my thoughts. Hopefully you can see the balance
through the whining. I'm really not saying that games are stupid, and
I'm not saying that I shouldn't try harder at enjoying games. I'm
somewhere in the middle, knowing at this moment how I feel, and a
little wavering as to how I&nbsp;should try to improve my perspective
in the future. I think I'll always be a sort of "let's go experience
something for real" kinda guy, more ready to rake leaves with people
than to play computer games (which is a whole different topic...).
But I need to continually consider broadening my preferences too to
accomodate what other people enjoy doing the most.</P>

<P>And that's a good thought too: While I've been busy doing things
with people, I've noticed this game thing, but I also need to be
quick to state that this past month or two I've had people walk with
me, jog with me, go bike riding with me -- outside things that I
enjoy doing and typically can't find anyone to do them with. So, it
is as always a balance and a compromise, doing some things that other
people enjoy and doing some things that I enjoy, all in the company
of the happy people around me. It all works out for good (or at least
useful) memories, and God builds character in us in many many
ways.</P>

<P>Bubble Hugs to you all. :-)</P>
