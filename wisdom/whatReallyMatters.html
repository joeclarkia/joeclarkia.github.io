<P>Okay, this is my fourth article in the past week or so. I promise
I'm not getting anti-writer's block, and I'll stop all this chatter
soon, or at least decrease the frequency. But I had one more thought
today that I think deserves my attention.</P>

<P>I was thinking today and pondering how I've gotten several fun
little electronic gadgets lately. None of these are really
"necessary" to my life, or really even my current lifestyle (except
maybe the new desktop computer). But they are nice things to have. I
am now able to listen to music more flexibly, I'm able to do computer
work in the park, and I can carry on a phone conversation in any
corner of the house. I am so blessed. I&nbsp;have arrived.</P>

<P>Well, not quite. As May comes to an end and I begin thinking about
the summertime, with all its floaty happy thoughts about being
outside and doing fun things, I want to remind myself that most
things in life are only tools. A tool may be quite flashy and fun to
use and have lots of power, but in the end it's only a tool.
Computers are tools. Gadgets are tools. Cars are tools. etc. etc. The
only two things I see that are not tools are God and people. In my
mind, the appropriate use of any of these gadgets should be as a tool
to reach some end relating to something that is not a tool in itself
(God or people). Of course, there will be moments or hours or days
spent working with the tools, perfecting them, learning about them,
and really just having fun with them. But again, I always intend to
remember that God takes highest priority, and people take second
priority. To that end, realizing that I have just acquired more
tools, I want to search for ways to use these tools to further the
causes of God in whatever way I can, and also to help people out in
some way.</P>

<P>For a simple example, I took a computer down to my Grandma's house
the other day and showed it to her. I allowed her to do some simple
things with it, which were new to her, but she was willing to work
with it for a few minutes. In my mind, that's an appropriate use of
the tool. I was spending time with people important to me, and in
some less relevant sense I was helping her learn how to use the tool,
in case sometime in the future she'll find a use for it.</P>

<P>Another note on this subject is that, within reason, I am also a
person, and using the tools to edify myself is an appropriate use of
tools. Listening to music in the car is one example. Enhancing my
ability to communicate with others by having a new phone is another
example&nbsp;(albeit a stretched one). I suppose that we often are
tempted at times to reject tools that will only benefit ourselves,
but if they **really do**&nbsp;benefit us, then they are useful. If
they only serve to, in the end, waste our time on this planet,
however, they are probably not worth the time and effort.</P>

<P>So, my goal for this summer, and for all time really, is to make
the days count. Whether that means using the tools or freeing myself
from them depends on the day and what my activities are for the day.
I expect to have days where the tools will come in very handy, and
will help me to serve others more effectively, or to increase the
"beautification engineering" quality of time spent on my own projects
(ya know, computing in the park for example is beautification
engineering). At other times, "the tools" should be the farthest
thing from my mind, and I should banish all concerns about them.</P>

<P>If I stick by these guidelines, I think I will make the most of
the tools and gadgets at my disposal, and it will take me further
toward the goal of making the most of my life as a whole.</P>
