<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I was thinking about worship music on this Easter
Sunday, and a thought occurred to me. It's not really a new thought,
but it is a bit of a restatement or a solidification of a way to
describe what I've thought of in the past.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In introduction, it seems to me that in a lot of
places the church "music wars"&nbsp;have quieted down in recent
years. A music war, as many of you are probably aware, is that great
battle of the generations and the stylists as to what the most
appropriate and meaningful style of music should be in the church
worship services. In most churches that I've been involved with, the
contemporary worship style has caught on, with perhaps a few
traditional songs mixed in, or a separate service set aside for
traditional music and style.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Now, what I've noticed about this general state of
things is that it's hard to find the right mix of music styles.
Often, the contemporary style is used without regard for any other
style. Where there is a mix, it's usually a compromise issue to
please the various camps of people attending the service. However,
the thought I&nbsp;had today is that this mix of music styles is a
key element in true worship. And this mix should not be based solely
on the audience's tastes, but instead on the intrinsic variety that I
believe God enjoys in worship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Heed the oft-quoted words of Solomon:</FONT></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-2"><B>There is a time for everything, and a
season for every activity under heaven: ... a time to weep and a time
to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance.... (Eccl
3:1,4)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I believe that these verses are very applicable in
worship services. One thing I've noticed recently (perhaps a problem
with my always-short attention span, or perhaps an inherent problem)
is that contemporary music tends to be played...and played and played
and played. Contemporary music tends to be repetitive anyway, and so
much more when the same song is played week after week. Not to
mention the fact that in praise services the verses of many songs,
which provide the most meaning in the song, are usually left out.
Church praise and worship sometimes seems to be a "Christian music's
top hits of the year" party. Actually, it's not of the year, more
like of the past two to three years. But the point is that there
seems to be a fairly short list of currently popular Christian songs
that are played over and over and over again, ad nauseum. Over the
recent winter (2002/2003), the favorite seemed to be the song "Come,
Now is the Time to Worship". I don't know how many times I've heard
this song, but it's been a ton lately. In one case, I visited another
church in another state, and I said to myself, "I'm going to laugh if
they play C.N.I.T.T.T.W. in this service." Guess what? They played it
first thing. Hello??? Variety? Non-boredom? Not stuck in a rut
singing the same song nearly every week in every church in the
country? Please?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">That is one pet peeve of mine. I don't mind
repeating a cool song some, but there are a lot of cool older songs
(older contemporary songs, as well as older hymn-ish songs)&nbsp;that
are rarely if ever played, because the new songs are repeated so
much. I don't think church is a current hits radio station, but
sometimes I'm not so sure. There is such a wealth of music out there,
with such a range of feelings and so many ways to impart truth, that
it saddens me that we rarely do more than scratch the surface of
what's available. Instead, we just use what's convenient, what we're
used to, and end up having a cookie-cutter worship experience. Sing
the same songs, think the same things, with little room for expanding
our minds and spirits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Now that I've vented, my real point in these
paragraphs is to point out the idea that besides just repeating songs
too much, many times the choice of music in service does not really
match the event at hand. I&nbsp;believe, strange as I&nbsp;am, that
music sets the mood for whatever is going on in the service. The mood
of the service, I believe, is a very important practical
consideration. If the message or the event is clear and powerful, but
the mood is wrong, at least the bored people such as myself will get
distracted or just tune out and think about some random
topic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Maybe most people don't really notice the music
style, especially if that music is supporting some other activity in
the service (distribution of communion elements, for example). But I
for one do notice it, and I think that the church service in some
sense should be a choreographed event, where all the pieces,
including background music, lead to the same concerted focus.
Background music should not be random, but should be done with
careful planning whenever possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What bothers me is that more often than not I've
seen some disregard for the importance of choosing the right music to
fit the occasion. And, in this disregard, the choice always boils
down to a selection from whatever the current happy favorite praise
choruses are. However, many times this is not the most appropriate
selection for the event. With a little planning and a little
forethought, a much more appropriate and more powerful song could be
found that would lead the worshippers into a more deep, more relevant
worship experience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">As I've said before, I believe God is a God of
variety. I think that the tendency towards flip hip homogenization of
church services is sad, and makes it a lot harder for me to worship.
There is a time to worship with loud boisterous songs. There is a
time to sing honest, even mournful songs. There is a time to worship
with quiet prayers. There is a time to worship with even quieter
introspective time. There is a time to worship with no music at all.
There is a time to reflect on the past and the former times, which in
many cases means singing some of the hymns or other favorites from
our former years. There is a time to worship with new music, fresh
from the heart of God. There is a time to worship in a multitude of
ways, and I think it should be our goal as followers and worshippers
of Jesus to celebrate that variety, to be aware of and make every
effort to partake in these various forms and moods of
worship.</FONT></P>
