<P>Well, my previous wise thought has caused a bit of discussion with
a third party who sort of acts as an accountability person in my
life. This is good, even though the statements in the discussions
aren't always what I&nbsp;want to hear. But these discussions, and
what I've been thinking about this weekend, are worth writing down.
They are in reference more or less to that previous wise thought
(<A HREF="anatomy_of_infatuation.html">Anatomy of Infatuation</A>),
so it may be wise to review that one first. Also I&nbsp;think that
this set of paragraphs will be more ... reasoned ... and less whiny
than that previous entry; that is my hope, at least.</P>

<P>One of the responses to my previous entry was the observation that
I&nbsp;give the impression that I have everything internally just as
it should be and so Ms. Whoever should be drawn to me in my current
"beautiful" state and appreciate my completeness ... something like
that. If I give that impression, please forgive the miscommunication.
Instead, what I'd like to portray is an idea of the direction I'm
heading in life, what "makes me tick" at a level deeper than how I
actually choose my steps. But even then, I do not claim that my
"ticking" is right, I just want to state as clearly as I can how I
think at the moment. (And why do I feel the need to state it at all?
because I'm a stupid-self-honest guy I guess.) If Ms. Whoever (or
anyone else for that matter)&nbsp;finds issue with my tick-nature, or
finds issue with where that tick-nature is taking me, then I would
gladly discuss those things. I would admit that I am a bit set in my
ways, and it is often hard for me to change, even in areas where I
know I should. But I think idealism and "becoming" is all about
change for the better, so I never intend to give the impression that
I'm saying, "I'm perfect, don't ya love me?"</P>

<P>Now, that was a preliminary topic. The main topic relates first of
all to what is a very serious problem I tend to have in my thinking,
and then to a potential way of solving or at least mitigating the
problem.</P>

<P>My problem is that I&nbsp;am a liability to the single women in my
life. I cannot say this for sure, but I&nbsp;am becoming convinced
that that is why so many people like my friendship just fine, but
they always make a point to steer clear of really getting to know me
very well. What I mean by liability is that, to put it in painfully
honest terms, I often try to take my friendships with women to a
"better than friends"&nbsp;state too quickly. Obviously I make this
focus one at a time, but over a course of a few years, I see this as
a pattern. You could say this is impatience. You could say this is
because I don't meet enough new people. You could say this is
loneliness of some sort. I don't know what it is that really causes
it, but for the observers in my life (not the least of which is
*me*), it becomes unfortunately clear that I have a problem in this
area. And for the "unsafe" people (unattached females) -- it makes
them feel like targets rather than friends; at least, it has the
potential to do that, and even from my side I know I tend to view
them differently. For a reverse example, I think in a way I really
can be more involved at a personal level with females who are
involved with someone else. My involvement cannot be in an immoral
way, of course, but because I know there are
no...possibilities...with someone who's not single, I&nbsp;don't go
into the "what if"&nbsp;mode, and because of that the friendship is
easier and less risky on both sides and probably actually more
open.</P>

<P>Well, with the admission of this observation, I suppose I only
serve to alienate my female friends even further. I know I should
just keep quiet and not tell people how I see myself. But I don't
keep quiet, and here is the one saving factor: I don't admit to these
things because I like these traits about myself. I admit to them
because I have a feeling they're already fairly well-known, and
because I&nbsp;want to make a change for the better. I want to have a
record of my struggle, I guess, and of my determination to make
positive progress. My problem is, perhaps, that I can talk all I want
but I still don't change. It's easy (sometimes) to recognize what
needs to be done or how I need to think differently...actually
changing my life (or my attitude) is a fair amount harder. But I know
that saying "I'm sorry" or more typical of me "I'm stupid" doesn't
make me less responsible for my attitude.</P>

<P>Well, in this case, in the case of the infatuation problem and the
"premature friendship elevation" problem, I've thought today about
the role of "community" in my life. I've noticed that my mind can be
preoccupied with infatuation-type thoughts, but often what is
required to break free from those thoughts is to surround myself with
other people -- a community -- where I can participate in friendships
with a number of people. In such a group, I am less likely to find
the need to single out one person at a time and focus so much
attention just on that one person. One caveat is that by
community&nbsp;I really don't just mean attending a church service or
Bible study or luncheon or chatting with coworkers at work or talking
to the waiter at the restaurant or talking to someone online. The
phrase that comes to mind is "hanging out." To adequately battle my
issue, I think the best medicine is to spend time in a social
environment with some people I'm already comfortable with as friends
or acquaintances in an informal setting where we can "build one
another up" and share together, not just in frivolous ways, and not
just in gut-wrenchingly deep ways, but in a moderate balance between
the two. THAT sort of activity, I believe, is one of the better ways
to combat the problem I described above.</P>

<P>Now, a couple reasons why that is hard for me: I don't get out
enough, in general. I keep myself busy with work and school, but of
course I could *make* time for more social activities if I determined
to do so. Another thing is that my social groups tend to be small,
and it seems that small groups have less social activities planned,
which makes it harder to socialize in a group.</P>

<P>Okay, those are my thoughts for now. I hope that this helps to
temper my whininess and foolishness in the previous wise thought. Put
the two together, and hopefully they'll balance out to a picture of
my state of being that makes some kind of sense.</P>
