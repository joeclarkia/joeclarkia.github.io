<P>Well, it's that time of year again. The classes are over, the
Christmas holiday is past, and soon it will be the new year. I like
New Year's. In a way, I like it just as much if not more than
Christmas. Christmas is remembering the world's most awesome event
(except, perhaps, for the Easter resurrection event). But New Year's
is, in a way, a more personal event -- a chance to think about how
the last year has gone, what has been good and not so good, and a
chance to make some plans for the near future.</P>

<P>With that said, it's time to think about 2004, and to plan for
2005. I suppose it would be wise to start with a review of my 2004
resolutions. Looking back at the appropriate wise thoughts, my
resolutions were:</P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><I>spend three hours a week outside (or
   at least in some kind of "communing" or
   contemplation),</I></FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><I>marginalize (give myself more time
   between activities and time to relax),</I></FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><I>lose 20 pounds by the end of the
   year, and</I></FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><I>contemplate my, uh, relationship
   status.</I></FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P>Well, the first two resolutions were beneficial to think about,
but never really materialized. I still kept busy, maybe too busy. I
did find that some of the best moments of 2004 were spent communing
(eg, reading "New Seeds of Contemplation" by Thomas Merton, watching
hot air balloons, and saying "AMEN"&nbsp;for no reason other than
event-free joy). As for weight, thanks to a little more careful
eating habits (but only a little), and plenty of running in late
summer and early fall, I lost about 15 pounds. Not quite my goal, but
it was an accomplishment, and I've managed to keep it off for the
last two or three months (despite the cheesy popcorn and pizza). And
finally, I&nbsp;am still single (surprise surprise), but I did have
plenty of opportunities to talk with various people about
relationships, and it's pretty clear that I built a lot of new
relationships and expanded old ones thanks to Watershed and PIGS.
Amen to that. Maybe it's not the time to be attached, or maybe I'm
just lazy, but in either case I think (I&nbsp;hope) I'm at least
learning how to be a right kind of guy ("man"), and that may be the
better goal anyway.</P>

<P>With the past year and recent events in mind, here are some ideas
that I think would be wise to focus on in 2005.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>Understand my attitudes
about being social.</I></B></FONT> As I've gotten involved in
Watershed this summer and fall, it has honestly been a bittersweet
time. Am I an introvert? Am I an extrovert? Well, it's fairly clear
that I'm an introvert. And yet I always am writing about people and
my thoughts about them. And I can have my crazy "bouncy" friendly
moments, so I can feel like an extrovert at times too, but maybe I'm
just trying to be something I'm not. Anyway, sometimes I "weird
myself out" with the way I think. I want to be with people, but
sometimes I just wanna stay at home. I want to love people and all,
but sometimes I&nbsp;just wanna be selfish too. I like talking to
people, but I find that talking on the phone, especially for long
periods of time, is just kinda draining. Sometimes I feel like most
of my friends aren't my peers exactly -- most aren't looking for
friendship and conversation on the same level as I&nbsp;am -- but
isn't that mean in some way? What's the deal with all that? I
honestly haven't figured it out, but in a social setting like
Watershed (and Hillside, to some extent), I need to work on these
issues. Maybe it's just a call for time management -- to decide how
much time to devote to big social things, and stick to it. Maybe it's
a call for activity prioritization -- big group social things vs.
smaller group socialization vs. one-on-one stuff vs. stuff with
family vs. stuff by myself. That's all part of the equation. I don't
have the answers yet, which is why it's a resolution. Think think
think.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>See people.</I></B></FONT> I
got the clue recently (again maybe) that I don't always really see
people. This came about recently with Christmas presents. What should
I get for those few special folks? I&nbsp;have NO&nbsp;CLUE, unless
they made a list. How unobservant is that? I can blame it on a bad
memory, or on lack of sleep, or some random thing, but I&nbsp;need to
work on being more observant of those around me, especially those I
claim to love in some fashion or other. In the midst of my thoughts
and actions, I&nbsp;think I've tended to focus on my own concerns, my
own activities. I intersect my life with the lives of others a lot,
but do I&nbsp;really pay attention to them, do I really listen, do I
really remember? Every once in a while I&nbsp;catch myself leaving a
conversation and thinking, You know I&nbsp;never really even looked
at them directly. Craziness. Or often I catch myself listening to
people talk but not really LISTENING, if you know what I&nbsp;mean. I
am a master at that, if "master"&nbsp;is the right word. I am so
often distracted by stuff (computers, often), and so I try to talk on
IM with someone, write an email, check a website, listen to music,
listen to the TV, AND&nbsp;talk to someone in real life..at least 2
or 3 of those at a time often...it gets complicated quick. So I need
to give people the time it takes to really listen, to have one
conversation at a time, to focus on one thing at a time.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>Don't whine so
much.</I></B></FONT> This sounds simple enough. But as I've said
before, I'm a whiny whiner! I still think it is (or was at one time
at least)&nbsp;tied in with this youthful idealism thing I&nbsp;talk
about, but I think at times it gets out of hand. Shut up and don't
complain...ya know. It's another paradox I live with, the paradox
between hope and joy and bitterness and whininess, which sometimes
don't seem so much like a paradox but as parallel expressions of the
same internal feeling (bitterness is little more than unrealistic
expectations and deferred hope). I'm not being true to myself to deny
either side of the equation. But I need to focus some attention on my
whininess problem, because I don't think it's very becoming, and it's
not a good "witness"&nbsp;and all that, and while I might not mind
being "irreverent"&nbsp;in some respects, I&nbsp;would prefer that
some more redeeming qualities would be the first in the minds of my
friends and coworkers.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>Be a man, but don't lose the
youthful idealism.</I></B></FONT> In a word to remember, "glitter".
Who would have thought that an evening of talking briefly about
liking glitter would end up as a New Year's resolution? But the talk
of glitter generated a discussion about what is attractive for a guy
and what's not, and glitter was not on the attractive list. This is
just the tip of a bigger issue: the issue of being "manly". For some
reason, I've never thought all that highly of being "manly". What,
talk deep? Yell about sports? Run after wealth and fast cars? Yearn
after getting to the top? Watch movies about people getting shot and
thieves scheming and superheroes doing unrealistic things? All that
is so shallow. Or maybe yell about the moral high ground? Or yell
about doctrinal purity? Those are reasonable goals, but seem a little
boring of themselves. And yet...remember Wild at Heart, that God
placed something in me as a male. Maybe the call of manliness is what
calls these typical things "shallow" and "boring". Whatever it is, I
should figure it out. But I won't settle for being a lazy couch
potato boring "all I know is sports and the weather" guy. I won't
settle for a TV&nbsp;stereotype, or (gasp) a pop-church stereotype
either. If I become a man, it will be on my (hopefully educated,
hopefully careful, hopefully spiritual)&nbsp;terms, modified by the
terms of those around me who I respect as good role models. And in
this becoming I&nbsp;will attempt to keep my youthful idealism (as I
call it), because I think that's one thing that makes me tick -- a
hope, a dream -- those are manly things too I think.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>Lose 20 pounds next
year.</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I> </I></B></FONT>Yeah,
keep up the health. I've actually allowed myself to cut a lot of
corners this year. "I'll be healthy tomorrow." Well, tomorrow (give
or take a few days) is 2005. I'm not saying I'll be Mr. Health,
but...I want to continue the good habit of keeping a focus on good
health, and focus on tweaking my lifestyle to some extent. One goal I
want to write down is to attempt to only drink 40 ounces (2
bottles)&nbsp;of pop per week. This is hard for me, because water is
often "boring"&nbsp;(for lack of a better excuse). But pop, diet or
not, is claimed to be rather bad for me, so good for me if I watch
myself a little more and try to cut back some. And, of course, I want
to keep exercising, running and biking and whatever else I find to
do, for exercise and for that hobo freedom and for pushing myself
toward a goal.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>Read more books.
</I></B></FONT>Thomas Merton was good to me this year. Thank you Ida
M for showing me his book. That book, along with Watershed, were
probably my biggest events of the year. Such good things to say. Some
books are boring, and all books take time, so I in my wispiness read
bits of books now and then but don't focus on them very much. I want
to focus more this year on first of all taking time to read books.
For one, I fully intend to read through the Bible this year, along
with several other Watershed people. But beyond that, I want to read
some other good-sounding books too, such as other Merton books, Wild
at Heart, the "Hobo" book, The Sacred Romance, and the rest that I
can't think of or will add to the list later. Besides just the
reading, the books force me to be quiet and stop moving and thinking
about a hundred things at once, and make me be quiet and focus on one
thing at a time -- that's a good thing for me.</P>

<P>There you have it. Resolutions for a new year. It's an exciting
time. I feel stressed already thinking about working on them all (by
the way, that's NOT&nbsp;the way to start the year out, so, the last
resolution will be <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000"><B><I>not to
stress over the other ones</I></B></FONT>..sigh). If life continues
as it has been lately, the new year promises to bring some good
conversations, both internally and externally, as well as some good
growing experiences in other ways too. Peace be unto you, and may
God's grace and peace and hope and love fill our lives as we journey
together on this happific thing called life.</P>
