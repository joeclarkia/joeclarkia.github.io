<P>I've had the occasion recently to meet a number of interesting
people through various activities. While I have come to enjoy the
process of meeting new people, I have noticed a small inconvenience
in the process that can seem disheartening. Technically, I just keep
this to myself and don't worry about it too much, but because I like
to blab about my insides sometimes, I'll tell you about this issue
I've noticed.</P>

<P>I think that in getting to know people, there are several "tiers"
of friendship. I'm not talking about the tiers that are inherently
found in established friendships (you know, the old "best friend" or
"okay friend" or "acquaintance" or "why don't they stop stalking me"
categories). I'm talking about the initial stages of friendship, when
we iron out in some sense how we will relate to one another. This is
an important stage, as a mistake in this area can permanently change
the outcome in the future.</P>

<P>So, what I've seen lately is that I'm fairly capable of taking on
the task of building a "Tier 1" pre-friendship with people. Given the
right circumstances (such as people who actually have time to carry
on a conversation and a small enough group that I actually have a
chance to communicate), I can ask all the introductory questions
about background, occupation, favorites, etc. These are the tier 1
questions, the questions that tell us who this stranger next to us
is, the questions that indeed turn the stranger into someone we feel
like we understand in some sense.</P>

<P>Now, here's my issue. I tend to be slow about moving from tier 1
to the next level. Tier 2, which I haven't defined completely yet,
includes some of the deeper issues. As a mild example, say that I met
someone and they told me, "I got fired from my job." Tier 1 would let
that topic slip away, since it might lead to other topics that are
not exactly appropriate for a tier 1 friendship. Tier 2, on the other
hand, would test the waters and (carefully) ask what happened. Tier 2
is secure enough in the conversation to ask some of the tough
questions (or on the other hand, willing to make a fatal mistake --
ie, if they're a worthy person they will forgive an honest
question).</P>

<P>That being said, let me also say that I *am* intensely curious
about the tier 2 topics...I mean, they are where "real life" comes
into play in many cases. Tier 2 is how you *really* get to know
someone, inside and out. But I shy away from Tier 2 questions
usually, since I tend not to want to push people away before I even
really get to know them. But such is the problem -- how do you get to
know someone without risking pushing them away? The simple answer, I
suppose, is that you don't, and sooner or later you have to just ask
the deeper questions.</P>

<P>Another dumb thing that I find in analyzing tiers in friendships
(mostly with people of that other gender -- how typical of me) is
that whole playfulness thing. I mean, some people can jump fairly
quickly from "What's your name" to "What's your outlook on life" to
"Where are you ticklish at?" (or alternatively, "What are you doing
tonight?"). I don't, or won't. It's sorta upsetting sometimes when
other people do move quickly like that, when I see the story yet
again that I *meet* people and these Tier 2-capable people *befriend*
them and quickly leapfrog my basic level of friendship.</P>

<P>Actually, jumping from mild tier 1 talk to something like, "What
are you doing tonight" --which is a restatement of that evil, "I'd
like to get to know you better" line -- is something I'd like to do
sometimes. But, unlike some people, I don't. I don't want people to
think that I entertain tier 1 only to jump to tier 2 or 3 or whatever
(even if there is some idea of that in my mind). I don't want people
to think that I have ideas of "I'd like to get to know you better",
because people tend to run away when you say stuff like that. But
other people say it, and the receiver of such a line doesn't run
away....so I guess there is a way to make it work, for some people
anyway.</P>

<P>So, to put it simply, meeting new people is an interesting but
confusing task. It can seem to be a slow process, but I would do well
to just take my own pace, and not bother thinking about the pace of
other people. If a friendship is meant to develop, it will, with
whatever pace is natural and appropriate. If the other person really
is playing Tier 1 because they can't wait to get away -- well, what
kind of friend would they be anyway? "Live your life, don't think too
much, don't ask for too much, but don't be afraid to reach out,
either." On the other hand, how many friendships do we allow to
wither and dry up (or to keep at arms' length for an indefinite
period of time)&nbsp;simply because we aren't willing to test the
waters of something better and more scary? But never mind that.
