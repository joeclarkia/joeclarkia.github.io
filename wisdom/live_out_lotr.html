<P>Have you ever watched Lord of the Rings and thought, "I wish my
life was exciting like that"? Have you ever considered that with some
warm clothes, a crisp morning, an audio Bible, some Ronan Hardiman
music, an MP3 player, a <A HREF="http://joeclarkia.net/gallery/2005-11-sunrise">camera</A>,
a stick, and a sack of garbage, your dream could come true? That's
what I discovered this morning.</P>

<P>It was 6:40 am. I was awake. (Yesssss.) I had made careful (late
night)&nbsp;plans to get up and watch the sunrise this morning. The
MP3 player was loaded. I was set. Sunrise was (roughly) 7:09 am.</P>

<P>My first stop was in the cemetery near my house. Just a few
pre-sunrise shots. Nice.</P>

<P>Then I&nbsp;went to my real destination -- the trail parking lot
near Tait Cummins. Last August or so I was out bike riding at
sunrise, and I watched it come up just over the train tracks. It was
cool, and I thought to myself, "I should come up here lots of
mornings and see how the sun moves with the seasons." yeah... today
was my first sunrise back there since then. And the sun had moved a
lot.</P>

<P>Following my plan, when I&nbsp;first saw the sunrise, I listened
to the song "Una Paloma Blanca." Some of the lyrics to that song are
"When the sun shines on the mountain and the night is on the run;
it's a new day it's a new way, and I&nbsp;fly up to the sun... over
the mountains I fly, yes no one can take my freedom away." In
elementary school we would do this little rhythmic movement called
"tinikling"&nbsp;to the rhythm of that (and other) songs. Ever since,
it's been in the back of my mind as one of those fun songs. I found
it on itunes recently, so I don't have to just remember it in my mind
anymore. Lately, I've deemed it the official Saturday morning song,
cuz..it's just how I&nbsp;feel on a lot of Saturday mornings, free
and with the chance to do whatever good I can find to do all day
long. Yesssss.</P>

<P>After the Una Paloma Blanca joyousness, I listened to Norah Jones
"Sunrise"&nbsp;song. It may not be quite as much of a fit, but, hey,
the name of the song is "Sunrise" -- gotta fit somewhere in there,
right?</P>

<P>Then I started walking down the trail. I turned to the audio Bible
stuff, and listened to the last halfish of Hosea, and to Joel and
Amos. Amos I listened to twice. It was the usual prophecy stuff, "You
have left me and followed after your idolatrous hearts; judgment
approaches." But, there was enough diversity in the reading this
morning to keep my attention for the most part.</P>

<P>As I walked, I ventured down on the trail closer to the river than
the paved trail takes you. What I&nbsp;discovered there was... acres
and acres of land that I had known about for as long as I've been
using the trail, but land that I've never really ventured out into
the thick of. (I've been down the unpaved trail a couple times, but
never stopped to "smell the roses" as they say.) So I&nbsp;had fun
being a wanderer .. hobo .. hermit .. contemplative .. all those good
things. I didn't have any particular topic on my mind, and I didn't
try to have any great huge thoughts -- I was just enjoying the
morning.</P>

<P>After the Bible reading, I started in with the Ronan music. And
thus enters the epic language of LOTR&nbsp;(finally). Ronan is an
Irish composer, and has had his compositions in things like "Lord of
the Dance." A lot of it is very "epic"&nbsp;sounding music I think.
It sometimes reminds me of Enya, but with more driving sound, more
drums, a little faster rhythm. So, my favorite epic movie is Lord of
the Rings (any of the 3). Thus, this became my epic morning.</P>

<P>So, as I walked along, I started seeing a few bits of trash along
the trail, and I&nbsp;thought, "I should be a good trail user and
pick up the litter." So, I thought about that on my epic morning, and
then I found a big huge sack without any big huge holes in it. It was
my, uh, ring..or..something. Then shortly after I picked up a dead
stick, and used it to fish some of the litter off the ground. It was
my sword. As the music drove on, I used the stick as well to "shake
hands" with the branches of trees and bushes along the path. When the
music reached crescendo, I at times rhythm-ed the stick in time with
the music (like a composer), or swished it through the air as if it
were an instrument or -- a sword, perhaps.</P>

<P>So in my quest to take the "ring"&nbsp;and "dispose" of it (get
it?), I found a couple of great out-of-the-way natural places to sit,
which were cool. I also saw a rock cliff looking thing that was close
to the trail, but invisible unless you're looking at it from below
(off the beaten path). Cool sights. And of course I saw lots of great
scenery along the way.</P>

<P>Finally, as my journey neared its end, I threw my stick back into
the creek..seemed fitting for such a natural traveling companion.
Then&nbsp;I threw the garbage into my car trunk (I guess I should
have thrown it into the fires of Mordor or something, but.. there
wasn't a garbage can around).</P>

<P>So, all that to say... this just goes to show that if you have the
right frame of mind, you can have your own personal epic adventures
at little to no cost. The "Wild at Heart" principle looks different
for different people. Some people climb rockfaces in Colorado. Some
people flail sticks and listen to music by the river. :-) Either way
works. Mine's just cheaper, and more repeatable. Is it any wonder
that I am a fan of the trails around here?</P>

<P>Okay, thanks for reading about my epic morning. If you couldn't
tell, it was a really cool time -- as time with God, as reliving
childhood songs, as enjoying nature, as thinking about life.. all
that kind of thing. You should all try it sometime. "The best things
in life are free."</P>
