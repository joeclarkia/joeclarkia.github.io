<P>I've had a thought in my head for a while that I've mentioned here
and there I suppose, but I felt like writing about it in just a
little greater detail here.</P>

<P>I went to a wedding today. It was a good day, a time to get to
visit with a number of old friends, not to mention being witness to
the wedding ceremony itself. I heard that one person has as many as
13 weddings to attend this year alone. It seems to be a year of
weddings, or something. Even some of the people from my past who had
no apparent significant other the last time I talked to
them&nbsp;(which was probably a year ago or more) are now engaged.
Besides hearing all this, I got to the wedding a little early, so I
got a chance to read a chapter or so in the book "When God Writes
Your Love Story", which I've been reading off and on for a few
months. And, I spent about five hours today travelling to and from
the wedding, which gave me time to think (and sing along with
music).</P>

<P>Put all this together, and I'm left in a bit of a bittersweet
mood. I'm glad for all those who are finding love in so many various
people and places. I'm glad for the wedding today ("even computer
engineers can get married--wow"). I'm glad for time spent with
friends. But my observations are: 1) Significant othership in
whatever form is a beneficial thing (despite all the jokes to the
contrary). It may be "better" to remain single to some people, but
there sure are a bunch of godly people getting married (and we'll
assume that my thoughts on the subject are not just to copy them or
to want what someone else has). 2) Lots of people that I consider
peers are now involved in relationships heading for marriage. 3) I'm
not. 4) I should wait for the right one to come along (that thought
is from the aforementioned book). And now, the random ones: 5) Even
people who are not significant others have varying levels of
friendship, and it means something different in thought and deed in
each case. 6) I shouldn't expect my friendships to match the
friendships of other people; they may be equivalent in value and
"realness", just not identical. (Or, just for the sake of anti-ness,
the anthesis of that thought is that I'm not as good as other people
and thus my friendships are not the same for that reason).</P>

<P>So what do all those points mean to me? Numbers 5 &amp;&nbsp;6
monopolize my thoughts, at least for tonight. What my mind is
thinking is that whatever I am is not good enough. I'm not saying I
have an inferiority complex. In fact, I probably think too highly of
myself, thinking that I&nbsp;have something to offer and that my
thoughts and actions are valuable even beyond myself. But what I am
saying is that whatever I am, funny or stupid, smart or senseless,
nice or rude, funny looking or cute, is generally not "attractive" to
people. Actually, maybe it is to an extent--the extent of making
people laugh. Laughter is good, but it is not the basis for anything
real of course. So my "crazy freaky slow java joe" ness might gain me
friends, even good friends, but almost always not the best of
friends.</P>

<P>So I see friendships all around me, and of course I compare them
to my friendships, and I am filled with joy at times, but tempted
with thinking "I wish my friendships were that good" at times, or
maybe, "I'm not 'good' enough for friendships like that", that is,
good in the eyes of anyone else, not really in my own eyes. I think
sometimes my personality conflicts with my mind. For example, I'm not
what you might call a "physical" person (at least I don't allow
myself to be). So when I see other people with friendships involving
that particular sense, I think, "Wow people hug me like once a year."
Okay, so it's not that bad, but you get the point. Now, does that
mean that I should get out of my comfort zone and, like, hug people,
or go up to people and say, "Hug me please"? (Would I really even
want that?) Or should I just tell self to be quiet and realize that
friendships are different, and not always better or worse? That's a
lesson that actually I'm just starting to think about (different vs
better friendships). Maybe I'll have more to say about that at
another time.</P>

<P>So to return to my main topic, life tells me, in plenty of teeny
little instances, that I&nbsp;am nice or something like that, but not
right for anyone, at least not yet. Even back to my freshman or
sophomore year in college (yeah it's only 3 years, but it seems like
a long time now), people have told me that I'm "nice"&nbsp;and would
make a good husband some day. That's definitely a compliment, and I
hope that my life would always evoke that sort of thinking on the
part of the world at large. But, I would hope that someday, out of
the blue, that sort of thinking would be evoked in some certain
individual who relates it to herself in particular, and not just in a
general platonic sense. So far, I&nbsp;have no knowledge of any such
person, and pardon my bitterness but I doubt that it has seriously
entered anyone's mind. I'm not saying that God doesn't have someone
picked out, I'm just saying I would be surprised if she had any
thought of it at the moment.</P>

<P>So, my advice to myself is to continue pressing on, not worrying
too much about being "good enough" to attract people, but rather just
being "good" in God's sight, continually learning more about how to
live in love to God and man, and how to make a difference in whatever
small way I can. My advice is also to not be concerned too much about
my friendships....to enjoy them, and cherish them, and cultivate
them, and make the best of them, but not to expect too much of them,
and to realize that friendships are not always to be compared as
better or worse in all cases (or maybe in any cases). Maybe someday
I'll live up to that advice.</P>
