<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>After a while you learn<BR>
the subtle difference between<BR>
holding a hand and chaining a soul<BR>
and you learn that love doesn't mean possession<BR>
and company doesn't mean security.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>And you begin to learn that kisses aren't
contracts<BR>
and presents aren't promises and you begin to accept<BR>
your defeats with your head up and your eyes ahead<BR>
with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>And you learn to build your roads today<BR>
because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans<BR>
and futures have ways of falling down in mid-flight.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>After awhile you learn that even sunshine<BR>
burns if you get too much, so you plant your<BR>
own garden and decorate your own soul<BR>
instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>And you learn that you really can endure<BR>
that you really are strong<BR>
and you really do have worth<BR>
and you learn<BR>
and you learn....</B></FONT>
