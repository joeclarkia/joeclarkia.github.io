<P>Today, by chance it seems, turned out to be a day of thinking and
interacting with people. For lack of a better way of doing it, I'll
go sequentially.</P>

<P>This morning was church, which went without much of a hitch. I
might get myself into the church choir, which would probably be a
good thing. I'm always talking about singing; I might as well join
the organized group of singers (and maybe learn to sing parts or
something crazy like that). In Sunday School we talked with S&amp;L
about the state of ministry in Russia and their plans for the future.
Quite interesting, and I think they do a good job of sharing their
excitement.</P>

<P>After church, about 7 folks from church, mostly PIGS, went to eat
at IHOP. I brought my dad and grandma along too. I was a little tense
about that, seeing as there is not one but two generation gaps there.
Well, we got into a good discussion with the six people at our end of
the table, talking about everything from faith to relationships. My
familyites didn't say too much in the conversation, but they were
following along and seemingly not bored. However, later I learned
that my grandma at least didn't think it was the best arrangement and
would prefer eating in a smaller setting (without all the young
church folks probably).</P>

<P>So herein is an issue. First of all, she is not stating anything I
can directly refute. Everyone has their peer group, and for deep
fellowship, or maybe even lunch fellowship, keeping within a peer
group is helpful. But it frustrates me (the truth of it, not my
Grandma's acting on it, so as to try and keep this conversation in a
generic sense like I&nbsp;like to do). So, my problem is that I know
that I have some distinct groups of people -- family members, church
members, high school friends, Iowa State friends, and now Watershed
friends. I am all about the small world principle I guess, and I
wouldn't have a problem mixing and matching between those groups, and
being pleased at bringing people together and allowing people to meet
one another.</P>

<P>The problem is that this nice idea doesn't work very well. First,
there is the purely logistic issue of group size. Sometimes the
conversation is hard to keep fair even among three people (or two for
that matter) let alone a large group in a crowded restaurant. This is
a problem for every large group I&nbsp;think, and I have a feeling
this is why cliques form. I&nbsp;mean, if 80 people could really talk
to one another, there may not be cliques, but I can't talk to more
than 4 or 5 people meaningfully at once. Even if I talked to each of
80 people meaningfully for 10 minutes per person, I'd never remember
all the information from 80 different people after 80*10 minutes.</P>

<P>So, in my conversations, I try to observe the subtle patterns that
occur. I noticed today that there were six of us, and four of us, and
the two groups didn't intermingle very much. Sure I wanted to talk
more to the other four, but I was wrapped up in conversation with the
six. Logistics. Junk. Maybe this is a need that will only be met in
heaven.</P>

<P>I've also noticed fairly frequently that it's really easy to have
a monopolistic conversation, either by being the transmitter or
receiver of monopolism. What I&nbsp;mean is, say you're at a mingling
event, and you'd like to, well, mingle. But there's one person that
talks about a topic of interest to you but not to most other people
in the room. So you basically are having a private conversation in
the midst of the group. This is fine I suppose, but it doesn't lend
itself to being social and talking to a buncha people. If this
monopolistic person is the one you most want to talk to, well, sweet
bliss. If not, though, it's frustrating. Ahhh, playing games with
who's more important. Favorites. Junk.</P>

<P>Anyway, after the lunchtime fun times, I came home and addressed
CD envelopes. They're going out in the mail tomorrow I believe...go
me for getting something accomplished. It seems that I have lots of
projects that are on my todo list but don't ever seem to get done.
And some of them (like software projects, which come along once in a
while), are never really done, because there's always some way to
perfect things more. Indeterminate endings. Junk.</P>

<P>Tonight I went to GBC for a special event. Some folks talked about
going to church camp; then we ate food in the basement. It is always
good to talk to the people there, both to remember times past (9
years ago now...time flies), and to catch up with how they're doing
these days.</P>

<P>After that I went to a Watershed pool party. I chose not to be a
poolite but rather a chairite on the side. It turns out that there
were several other chairites as well, so I&nbsp;didn't get lonely. I
spent some time getting to know someone that goes to Watershed that
has been visiting/attending Hillside lately. (The small world
principle...it's all over the place in this ol' town.) I talked to
most of the usual suspects as well, and had a fun time overall. But
here is another example of a large group activity. There were
probably 50-60 people at the pool, and I talked to a fair number of
them, but not too many in great detail. But I did have a few
conversations that I think are obviously meaningful, so I won't
complain about that tonight.</P>

<P>On the way home from Bowman Woods pool I played a Michael Card
tape. Cool Cool Cool. For the last week or so I've been trying to
start reading a book by Thomas Merton on "new seeds of
contemplation", and that seems to be a theme that's working itself
out in my head these days. Church, people, maybe work, music...all
are slowly leading me towards a more contemplative life. I don't even
know what that means, and it's not like this hasn't been going on for
years, but at least at this point I have a sense of excitement about
stuff in general, hence my phrase, "Life is still beautiful." Hence
my saying "AMEN" for no reason when watching a hot air balloon. Hence
my high-attention-and-enjoyment factor while listening to Michael
Card on the way home. I suppose to be completely spiritual, I might
say, "God is doing a work in me." It sounds kind of inaccurate,
because I think God's been doing this work in me for a long time, but
I&nbsp;just seem to be extra aware of it in the last weeks or couple
months, and it's a good feeling. Anyway, God's joy be upon us all.
:-)</P>

<P>So some wrapup thoughts that turn down an old path: Part of our
discussion today at lunch was about relationships: LDR, online
dating, who should make the first move, the physical aspect -- quite
a few topics actually. Predictably maybe, I think the one I most
remember is the topic of who should make the first move. Here's my
bitterness: I&nbsp;never wanna make the first move. I may play
around, but I don't usually come right out and say it. I would follow
down a path of "mutual moves"&nbsp;if that makes any sense, but I
would hesitate to start something from scratch. Now, this is
problematic because I think other people rarely make the first move
either, so I just end up getting over people. Now, in slight
contradiction, after I overanalyze everything for about 50 years too
long, on rare occasions I will make a move, but only after I've blown
everything out of proportion and thoroughly messed up my own mind to
the point that "it" probably wouldn't work out at all anyway. When I
do make a move, the answer is always no anyway (has been in the past,
and why should I expect the future to be any different short of God
Himself intervening in an unprecedented way in the affairs of the
heart?), so in this case too I end up getting over people. That's
what I said at lunch today, and this paragraph explains why. Call me
bitter, because I am. But, as is so great about the human spirit (so
far for me at least) I get over it, and I snap back to my safe
contemplativeness. As long as I focus on people in general and not on
individual people (you know what I&nbsp;mean), life has been shown to
be quite nice. The trick is to make the snap-time as fast as
possible, to reduce the time in agonizing stupidity.</P>

<P>And, to top it off, relationships mess up my life. Or, more
correctly, liking people messes up my life. I don't know what a
relationship would do -- I'd have to have one to know what it would
do. Liking people always makes me think in very juvenile ways I
think, and play mental games more akin to middle school than
enlightenend adult life. Maybe I overstate the case, maybe it's just
normal, maybe it makes me dysfunctional, but it seems to be the truth
anyway.</P>

<P>So, in light of all I've said today, I hope my life will be about
pursuing God, not in the cliche way of...whatever my mind
automatically turns to by 25 years of typical words, but about
pursuing him with all my heart in my own (Biblical of
course)&nbsp;way. It's one of those "contemplative"&nbsp;kinds of
ideas that maybe can't be explained, but maybe you can sympathize in
your own contemplative way. And, I guess I wish that if I feel like
liking someone, I will do my best to put that recipe for stupidness
under the control of the ever-widening span of God's love and
fulfillment of dreams in my life. Basically, what I&nbsp;wanna do is
live a life of figuring out what it means to love God and love people
in the God way, and if some of that love people romantically stuff
comes along, so be it, and thanks be to God. Whether I can keep that
focus, or whether that sort of focus is *really* what God even wants,
though -- that I haven't a clue about.</P>

<P>In any case, it's getting late, and ready or not the hour of
working approacheth. I will continue to ponder my old issues and
maybe come up with some new thoughts on them, and if I find the
answer to the universe, I'll let you know. Otherwise, I'll try to
find more hot air balloon random moments to say, "AMEN" about. Good
night, and "think tight"&nbsp;as the contemplative teenagers might
say. :-)</P>

<P>PS:&nbsp;If you read this, will you send me an email? I would like
to know if anyone reads this stuff. I've said it before, but I think
what I have to say is interesting, but I&nbsp;never really have a
chance to talk about it in depth with anyone but myself (yes it's an
exaggeration, sorry), and as much as I&nbsp;say, "it's on my web
page", I think I'm the only one who's excited about reading my
writing. To be expected, I suppose, but sad too. I guess some of this
stuff is sorta too deep to talk about in typical conversation, so I
take the reverse approach and talk about cheesy stuff and all. That
works, but always remember -- I have a much more interesting deeper
side too, for those who are willing to dig down to find it and show
that they wanna hear it.</P>
