Ages</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><B>1. Clearing Your Mind</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6600">Take a step back.  For a moment, leave
behind your preconceived ideas.  Leave behind what time and
experience have told you.  Leave behind what you've heard, what
you've been taught and learned in days gone by.  Come and join
me...in the story of the ages.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#009900"><B>2. Back To the Beginning</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#009900">It was a time before all time.  "Eternity
past," as the scholars and theologians would say.  In this -- this
place, this time, all that we have known and have come to call
permanent was nonexistent.  Except -- except for One.  God Almighty,
the Ancient of Days, the Divine Trinity -- mystery of mysteries --
was all that was.  And this God -- this unfathomable force, was ...
seeking to share His nature.  His nature was and is one of love --
pure, absolutely holy -- beyond our understanding.  This God of love
-- mystery of mysteries, created man to share His love with and to
glorify Himself.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#009900">Genesis 1 and 2 tell us of a God who, with
infinite power and infinite knowledge, created...bringing forth our
forefathers from Himself.  And there was communion -- the glorious
thought -- between these creatures -- the man and the woman -- and
their Creator.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0066FF"><B>3.  The Betrayal</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0066FF">In God's higher wisdom, He realized that
obedience and fellowship, if it is to be meaningful, must be
voluntary.  So God, in creating man, endued him with freewill -- the
ability to choose right or choose wrong.  And mankind, exercising
this freewill, chose to do wrong, chose to abandon this perfect
fellowship with God.  They chose to believe a lie -- the  lie that
says there is a greater fulfillment than God can provide.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0066FF">God's heart was broken.  He had created man
in hopes of sharing Himself -- of giving love, and of having it
returned, all in a perfectly holy way.  Now, that hope was dashed. 
Throughout the centuries that followed, God sought after the fallen
human race, but again and again they rejected Him -- rejected their
Maker, mistakenly thinking they could find pleasure and fulfillment
in something other than God -- in their idols, their immorality,
their injustice.  They grew further and further from the truth,
straying...straying...falling...being lost.  In all this, God was
there, watching, seeking, hoping they would turn their hearts back to
Him.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>4. The Unveiling</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">In the course of time, God's sovereign plan
brought about a new thing.  The abodes of God and man, separated for
so long by corruption, were brought together once more.  God Himself,
in the person of Jesus, came from the glory of Heaven to the earth,
now dying in its sin.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">This man Jesus was God's new Word -- his
perfect solution to imperfection.  Jesus the God man walked among us,
and showed us humans, now thoroughly lost in sin, the way back home,
the only way to return to what we had lost, a right relationship with
God.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Jesus, being God in the flesh, could have
come in might and power and judgment, taking vengeance on these
creatures who had so rejected His love and despised their created
purpose.  He would have had every right to thoroughly rid the earth
of them -- of us as a race.  But that was not God's nature.  God
created us for communion with Him, and this was still His
desire.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">God saw so much...potential...in us humans
that He was even willing to endure crucifixion, the most cruel
punishment that these corrupted creatures could invent.  Think of it
-- God in the flesh, exposed to physical pain in the extreme,
ridicule, public scorn, and ultimately, death.  All to pave the road
back home.  All to give us the chance to once again have communion
with God.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#660099"><B>5. New Life</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#660099">God...dead?  The author of life...lifeless? 
Unthinkable!  Mystery of Mysteries. And ultimately...temporary!  This
Jesus, this God-man, did not remain in the grave.  The greatest
moment of elation and hope...the call rang out, "Jesus is alive!" 
The heavens resounded with the sound.  On earth, those who realized
this tremendous act of love by God, also sang forth in jubilation and
amazement.  New life was now possible -- reconciliation, and the
promise of a restored relationship with God.  Finally, the sin of
Adam and the pattern of transgression could stop.  The alienation
could come to an end.  Love, for so long choked by the pollution of
sin, could once more be found holy and pure.  Communion between
creator and created was again possible.  The call still rings out to
the earth -- Hallelujah -- Praise the Lord.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>6. Fulfillment</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066">Our story nears an end.  And yet, there is
more.  For while relationship was restored, those who realized the
importance of Jesus' work still were trapped in an imperfect world. 
They knew God, but not completely.  They had friendship, but not in
its fullness.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066">So it is today.  Those who choose to follow
-- to restore themselves to their Creator -- are still trapped in a
body and a world of corruption.  God gives power to overcome personal
sin, but there is a greater fulfillment to come.  For those who will
seek Him, for those who will accept His offer of reconciliation, the
promises to be with us now, inhabiting our prayers and praises, and
forever in reality.  Life with God -- now and forever.  That, my
friends, is the story of the ages, the supreme goal of God Himself. 
Hopefully, it is your goal as well.</FONT>
