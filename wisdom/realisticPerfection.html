<P>I had a thought today. Good for me. :-) I&nbsp;think it's probably
a pretty basic idea, but it's worth saying anyway I think. So I'll
share it with you.</P>

<P>As we go through life, I think that we, whether we admit it or
not, spend our days looking for perfection and beauty. We in our
dreams dream great dreams of life filled with love, hope, light,
bright colors, warm breezes, etc. However, in our non-dreaming
moments we realize that life is very seldom if ever perfect. Very few
things or moments truly and completely satisfy.</P>

<P>For some examples: people are not and can not be perfect. Even if
friends and loved ones swear their allegiance and mean it, there are
always car accidents and cancers and car bombs to make that promise
unkeepable. Hot air balloons (typical of me, huh?) can not be
perfect; there are always those 15 MPH&nbsp;winds to ground them.
Bike rides are not perfect; there are always winds and heat and flat
tires and traffic to restrain the joy. Reading books is not perfect;
there is eye strain to worry about. Hiking is not perfection; there
are muscle aches afterwards. Listening to music is not perfect; songs
get old and we get restless. Traveling is not perfection, because you
always have to come home, and because you can't escape from yourself.
Nature is not perfect, because where there are grand sights there are
bears and rattlesnakes, and where there are flowers and brilliant
colors there are also thorns and bees. Possessions are not
perfection; it is obvious to the honest that possessions are only
grown-up toys -- useful and pleasurable, but usually not the
perfection we seek. And the list could go on....</P>

<P>Well, you get the idea. So there is a lack of perfection. The
thought that energized me today is that while there is a veil of
imperfection over our lives, there are also a million pinpricks of
sheer light and true perfection that we can catch a glimpse of beyond
the veil. This veil that we sense around us is sometimes quite thin,
when life is joyous and the perfection seems almost within reach; at
other times the veil hangs over us as the dark of night. But as the
dark of night has pinpoints of starlight shining through, so our
lives and our circumstances have pinpricks of beauty and perfection
shining through, should we choose to find them.</P>

<P>So, when the times come when all that seems visible is the veil
and the darkness, I hope you will have the ability and hope to look
beyond the veil to see the holes where the light -- the perfection --
is shining through. It is those bits of light that help us get
through the veiled times, and everyday life too, really, because
everyday life has its share of imperfections and unmet dreams
too.</P>

<P>That's all for now. Just something to, um, brighten your day with.
Ponder it, and be happy. :-)</P>
