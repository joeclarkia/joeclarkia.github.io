<P>In the midst of an interesting discussion tonight, I realized that
the current quote on my "<A HREF="wife.html">Wife Page</A>" may be in
error. The quote is from a Burlap to Cashmere song:&nbsp;"You have
one wing, I have another; ... like one angel we'll fly far away."
While that line has probably been enjoyed by many sentimental folks
such as myself, is it possible that it is dead wrong? Is it possible
that, at least in the context I used it, it has no resemblance to
reality?</P>

<P>The basic question could be phrased as, "Why do people get
married?" or "What is the purpose of marriage?" To help think about
these, I'd like to discuss the "completing" and "complementing"
arguments for marriage. It is commonly held that dependence (relying
on a spouse for completion) is bad, and because of that a husband and
wife should not be overly dependent on one another. More applicable
to my situation are the typical statements that as a single person I
should be working on building my own life as a godly righteous person
and I should seek out a vision from God for my life individually
instead of seeking to find a wife to somehow complete my restless
life. On the other hand, people also tell me from time to time that
if I want to "find someone" someday, I have to work at it now (I
can't just sit at home and write web pages and expect The One to make
herself known). They remind me that even though God is up there
guiding, He does expect us to use our minds and take some steps
ourselves as well in our lives. But that is beside the point. The
point is that, according to some or most, the point of marriage is
not to find personal completeness, but to join visions with another,
and to pursue the same goals together, and encourage one another
along the way -- something like that.</P>

<P>Well, I have some issues with that. Realize, of course, that like
all of my writings on this subject, I write from a fairly complete
lack of any real experience on these matters, and so I have no
credibility except my vicarious musings. (This bothers me, but who
gives me a choice in the matter?) So anything I say that sounds
reasonable (or unreasonable) is probably just idealistic babble, and
everyone knows that idealism is the realm of philosophers and
dreamers who sit on rocks by lakes watching sunsets (or by engineers
sitting in front of computers listening to nature music), not by real
people living real lives. That being said, I have thoughts on the
whole "marriage==completion" theory.</P>

<P>I think there is value in saying that there is a lot of learning
to be done before one is ready for marriage. This is obvious. I am
not saying that learning is complete in my life. I am reminded from
time to time that I still have areas in my life that hinder me from
being the kind of husband I should be (I laugh to connect myself with
the word "husband"). I know very little about relationships of this
sort and how to make them work. I *think*&nbsp;I know something about
them from thinking about biblical principles and from listening to
others who have a clue. But in reality I am inexperienced, and that
inexperience prevents me from knowing anything with any amount of
certainty. But in my humble view, I find that the complementing
theory doesn't always make sense. If it is true that I should be
completely independent and happy as a single before I'm ready for
marriage, then what's the point? If I'm complete and happy being
single, and I believe as they say that marriage is hard work and
marriage is distracting and all that, then why should I get married?
Why do we hear how great it is at every wedding if God prefers the
single life? When have you heard marriage spoken of as the
second-best option -- not at any wedding I bet. If we are supposed to
be need-based as Christians (giving up what is not essential), and
marriage is never truly a "need" but only a nice addition to our
life, like a new pool table or a nice piece of artwork on the wall,
then why should we seek it or glorify it at all? I'm being sarcastic,
but maybe you see a glimpse of my dilemma.</P>

<P>So with this in mind, I am tempted to believe, fool that I
apparently am, that the "completion" theory has its attractive
qualities. For one, it doesn't tell me to be perfect before I can
look for something more. I'm not too worried about this one, because
it seems to me that while I have a lot to learn, I am on the path,
and someday I will be "perfect enough" and "independent enough" to be
worthy of a real relationship, that is, if anyone ever chooses to
notice that worth. I may be thoroughly disgusted and bitter-ified
with all such ideas of "love and junk" by that time, but never mind
that. I think what makes the completion theory more attractive is
that it is...well, more sentimental. Sorry, I'm sentimental. I don't
always think with my head. Oops me. But the complementing theory
reminds me of business partners: "Your vision is to go in direction
X. That is my vision as well. By combining efforts we can move
forward faster and accomplish more. We can achieve. Therefore, we
should be partners. Amen." Well, joy, but that's very matter-of-fact
and lacking in emotion. Oops, I&nbsp;said the e word. The
complementing theory seems like more of a surface level bond. I am
always the one searching for the deep things (ie real in both logic
and feeling). So given the choice between something deep and a
business partnership, guess which I tend to prefer...</P>

<P>Now, my thoughts on "deep" are probably misguided as well. I
suppose I often think that mushy=deep, or emotions=deep. As everyone
who has a clue tells me, that theory is dead wrong, and quite the
opposite is true: emotions are at least 30% evil and while they may
run deep, they are fleeting and do not last. Emotions lead us to make
invalid assumptions -- they lie to us -- and are to be handled like
fire, apparently, and doused with a firm sense of realism often. Such
is the wisdom of the wise. But there comes a time in life when we can
learn, and learn, and share and share, and experience and experience,
but we still ask, "Is there nothing more?" I am speaking in
anti-parables here, because at the forefront of my mind for this
moment is the problem of experiencing God and feeling emotions
relating to God. And this pursuit -- trying to "feel" God, aka trying
to know Him in reality and not just in the abstract contrived sense
-- seems to be a worthwhile and necessary goal, all discussions of
pure doctrine aside, if we handle things carefully. But the advice in
relationships with fallen people is to avoid emotion and base
relationships on ... whatever else we can find ... rather than
emotions. Maybe that's okay, but what else do we base them on?
Commitment? Right....fickle people (which includes most if not all of
us) break commitments often, even the most sacred ones, and people
change, and commitments that were once honored can sometimes be
thrown away. Commitments that are not sealed in writing (which
includes all of a relationship up until the wedding day) are as
easily discarded as an old newspaper, given the right circumstances.
What else might we base relationships on? History and a shared past?
That too is not a highly solid foundation, because history is
history, and the present is reality. Or maybe shared beliefs? It is
sadly true that those who share similar beliefs do not always see eye
to eye on many things, and even if people agree on 99%, it may be the
1% that drives people apart over time. Or simply assumptions? Well,
that's a common base, but assumptions have a way of being wrong, and
relationships based on assumptions tend to go nowhere good fast. So
while emotions, even "wise emotions" are not a solid foundation for
things, so they say, the other, more solid foundations are not
necessarily solid either. So I maintain for now that searching for
the deep things, even if those are the emotional things, is not a
completely totally misguided search.</P>

<P>Let me add to that, though, that I think searching for the deep
goes beyond feelings. When I think deep thoughts, I'd like to believe
that I mean more than emotions. I'd like to believe I mean things
like searching to find God in a new way (that sounds mystical, but I
mean it in a mostly-traditional way). I'd like to believe that I can
think about deep things like stargazing and pondering the universe
without it being a feelings-dominated picture. But it is true,
honestly, that a lot of the deepness I search for is tied up in
emotion and feelings.</P>

<P>Okay enough about that. This talk of feelings serves as
introduction to the completion theory. This theory says that when two
people join themselves together in marriage, they actually fit like
two wings to form one bird, or two puzzle pieces to complete the
puzzle, or two halves of the yin yang. This is a cute idea, and is
symbolically pleasing, and *I* think it seems to be the tone of some
of the scripture verses talking about marriage (the two will become
one flesh, etc.). But while the basic idea might be okay, apparently
in practice the completion theory is evil because if people are
overly dependent on one another (a logical restatement of completion
theory), the situation can go sour quickly. Dependence on another
human, as everyone is so fond of saying, is like depending on a
splintering stick. No one is perfect, especially in relational
matters. People let us down, that is a fact of life, and so depending
on another will always lead to pain and suffering. The situation is
even worse when the dependence only goes one way -- one person is
dependent, the other is not. It is rarely the case that both partners
are equally dependent, and thus problems arise when one pulls on the
other more strongly, and if not dealt with, this stress can rip the
relationship apart.</P>

<P>Now, in response to that, I ask...is there a difference between
dependence (needing another for some sense of completion) and some
crazy addiction that can rip a person's life apart? It's true that
dependence can lead to addiction, but does it have to? Does it
always? I'd like to think it doesn't. I think of things like the
verse I mentioned above, and I think that there is (and, gasp, should
be) an element of dependence involved. When two substances become
one, in some ways they are no longer known as two but one. Of course
in marriage the two people are still individuals, but I wonder if God
means for it to be as individualistic as the complementing theory
makes it out to be at times. Individualism can reduce vulnerability,
but it also reduces closeness. Idealism says that marriage is
supposed to be about closeness and togetherness as opposed to strict
individualism (or business-like individualism). Idealism says that
marriage is not just a business partnership. It *is* to be two people
looking outward with one vision, but is that *all* it is? ... But I
know, idealism is stupid and wrong and probably comes from watching
too many sappy movies and making too many wishes in life.</P>

<P>So what do you think? Is that original quote about two wings
wrong? Is it based on a false assumption of marriage bringing a sense
of completion? I'm not totally sure of my opinion, because I realize
I'm just guessing, but you can see my perspective from the above
paragraphs. Maybe someday someone will help me to see
(non-vicariously) the difference between idealism and reality, and
show me that marriage and all such bittersweet topics are a matter of
complementing rather than completion. Until then, I will search for
the answer in my typical aloof way, and try not to be too biased by
my idealistic assumptions.</P>
