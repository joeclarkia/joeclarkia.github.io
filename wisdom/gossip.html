<P>Well, you know it's unusual when I edit myself. But here I am,
eating my words, in a way, and presenting a more traditional view of
gossip than usual (most of you probably did not see the essay that
was here before).</P>

<P>I still don't know exactly how gossip is rightly defined, but I
know the Bible condemns actual gossip along with murder. Our rebuke
and exhortation can righteously only be dealt with one-on-one,
offended to offender, and that only carefully and after prayerful
consideration. When the other party won't reasonably listen...I have
no answer for that. Live with it, I guess.</P>

<P>For the rest of the polite thoughts on gossip, see the following
link:</P>

<P><B>Amendment 1 (10/3/99)</B>. - I also think crying gossip is an
excuse to not have to deal with a problem. Someone tells you, "You're
gossiping" and all of a sudden you're forbidden to talk about it.
It's a very convenient way to avoid life. If there is no "gossip," no
trying to solve real-world problems where people are unfortunately
involved, will anything ever get solved? We say we hate secrets, but
we live our entire lives as secrets when we refuse to talk about
anything or anyone in any way that might in the least sense seem
disrespectful, even if it is clear that we are acting in humility,
expressing our opinion, or just venting. The cause of the restorer,
one who hopes to make things "right" or at least better, is crushed
by the 2 words, "You're gossiping."</P>

<P>"I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no
divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and
thought." -- 1 Corinthians 1:10</P>

<P><B>Amendment 2 (1/8/01)</B>: Well, as you have probably figured
out, the link above no longer works. And since the heat of the moment
has passed, here are my original, uncensored thoughts on gossip...I
may or may not still hold these attitudes, depending on my mood --
they were my thoughts at the time: &#91;<A HREF="oldgossip.html">oldgossip.html</A>&#93;</P>
