<P>I have often noticed in my life that I am naturally drawn to the
people who have time for me. On the flip side, the people who don't
have any time to spare annoy me. There are a lot of people in this
world that are so crazy busy that their schedules virtually block me
out (that could always be by design, and that is taken into
consideration here as well). I would like to present some
mathematical ideas for a way to characterize the actions of people
and for rating people as to how "rejective" they are. I know,
I&nbsp;know, such characterization of people is not very nice, but oh
well. Rejection isn't very nice either.</P>

<P>First of all, I would like to make the rejection ratio a fairly
open concept. I want to present some guidelines here and ideas for
some possible values, but in the end the actual values assigned
depend on the person and the situation at hand. Just try to be
consistent in your own use of this, and the ratio should be
meaningful to determine who is rejective and who is not. The values I
assign to the various types of rejection are characteristic of what I
generally consider to be the hurtfulness of the various kinds of
rejection..you'll see what I mean.</P>

<P>Okay, now let's move on to discussing the preliminaries. Rejection
is defined as when you invite someone to do something with you, and
they decline your offer for any reason. Now, the "rejectional value"
of the refusal may approach 0, depending on how good of an excuse
they have, or it may be negative, if they turn the rejection into a
counter-invitation or if they do not reject you at all. Keep those
things in mind. The most common types of invitations that this ratio
will deal with are the following: in person conversations, phone
calls, IM&nbsp;conversations, emails, group outings, and one-on-one
outings. Let's analyze each in a little more detail...</P>

<P><B><I>In-person conversations: </I></B>These conversations are the
conversations that come up fairly randomly -- at church, at work, in
a chance meeting at Walmart. I guess I'm mostly thinking here of the
truly Walmartish occasions, not the greeting time at church or the
random work conversations. Here are some guidelines:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If the other person sees you but ignores you, assign 5
   rejection points (RPs).</LI>
   
   <LI>If the other person sees you and begins talking to you, but
   then someone else comes along and they begin talking solely to the
   other person, assign 4 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the other person says something like, "Hi I'd love to stay
   and talk but I have to go wash my cat," assign 5 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the other person talks for a few moments, then leaves,
   assign 4 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the other person talks until you feel the conversation is
   rightfully over, assign 0 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the other person talks longer than you think is necessary,
   assign -3 RPs (since they are giving extra time to talk to
   you).</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Phone calls: </I></B>Phone calls are interesting phenomena,
and their importance depends to a large extent on the personal
preferences of the people involved. Some people talk on the phone for
hours, some people get off as quick as possible....here are my
guidelines.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If you call someone for the first time in a long time, and
   they say they are busy, and don't offer to talk sometime later,
   assign 10 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you call someone for the first time in a long time, and
   they say they are busy, but do offer to call back, and never do,
   assign 15 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you call someone for the first time in a long time, and
   they say they are busy, but do offer to call back, and they do,
   assign points as for a normal conversation below.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you call someone for the first time in a long time, and
   they speak to you on the phone, but they seem to be bored talking
   to you and giving you the vibe, "Hang up, you boring person",
   assign 5 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you call someone for the first time in a long time, and
   they speak to you on the phone, and they seem happy to talk to you
   and the conversation goes well, assign 0 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you call someone for the second time within a week, assign
   points at half the value given above. If the conversation goes
   well, assign -3 RPs, as they are showing a little extra interest
   in you by talking for the 2nd time in the week.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you call someone for more than the second time in a week,
   assign points at 1/4 the value given to begin with. If the
   conversation goes well, assign -5 RPs..they must really think
   you're cool to keep talking to you.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>IM&nbsp;conversations:</I></B> IM&nbsp;conversations are
those fun online conversations. They are fairly informal, and can
last for a few hours or a few seconds.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If you IM&nbsp;someone for the first time in more than 3 days,
   and they ignore the request, assign 5 RPs (but be prepared to
   rescind the penalty if you find out they had a good excuse for not
   responding).</LI>
   
   <LI>If you IM someone for the first time in more than 3 days, and
   they say something like, "Hi, I'm shockingly busy, much much too
   busy for you,"&nbsp;assign 10 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you IM&nbsp;someone for the first time in more than 3 days,
   and they say they're too busy, but offer to talk later, assign 0
   RPs. If 2 days pass without a word via email or other means, add 7
   RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you IM&nbsp;someone for the first time in more than 3 days,
   and the conversation is okay, but ends without a real ending,
   assign 1 RP (this ending would seem to say they were bored talking
   with you). However, if they were the last person to post a
   message, assign -1 RPs (since you were the one looking bored and
   unresponsive).</LI>
   
   <LI>If you IM&nbsp;someone for the first time in 1-3 days, use the
   scale above, but cut the RPs in half.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you IM&nbsp;someone more than once a day, no RPs should be
   assigned. You can't ask for too much ya know.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Emails:</I></B> Email rejection can vary a lot. Some people
you hear from once a month or once a year, and that's all right
(kinda like the Christmas letter). Some people you expect to hear
from at least once a week...these factors have to be taken into
consideration in the guidelines below.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If you email someone expecting a response (having at least one
   clear question in the email), and they fail to respond within a
   month, assign 10 RPs. For each additional month until you don't
   care anymore, send a reminder/refresher email, and add 1 to the
   number of RPs assigned (11, then 12, etc) if they don't
   respond.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you email someone expecting a response (having at least one
   clear question in the email), and they respond within a month but
   not within a week, assign 3 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you email someone expecting a response (having at least one
   clear question in the email), and they respond within a week but
   longer than 3 days, assign 1 RP.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you email someone expecting a response&nbsp;(having at
   least one clear question in the email), and they respond in 1-3
   days, assign 0 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If you email someone expecting a response (having at least one
   clear question in the email), and they respond within 24 hours,
   assign -3 RPs. Wow.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the email response above contains significantly more
   personal content than your email did, add -3 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the email response above contains significantly less
   personal content than your email did, add 3 RPs.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>Group outings:</I></B> These outings could be church group
social events, coworker parties, movies, or anything else where a
group is involved. Care must be taken not to assign RPs where there
is a valid reason for not attending the event (eg a schedule
conflict).</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If the group size is larger than 7, do not assign RPs either
   way, unless the invited person is an outsider to the group or has
   some other valid reason for not attending the event...if the
   person does attend the event in that case, assign -5 RPs -- that
   person is showing an interest in joining you in the event even if
   it's something new for them or possibly awkward.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the event requires money, weigh the cost and the person's
   ability to pay honestly.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the event requires a substantial amount of time, weigh that
   consideration honestly.</LI>
   
   <LI>If there is no obvious reason for the refusal, assign 1
   RP....group events are typically casual events, and a person needs
   to feel free to come or go as they please. But, because you are
   inviting, it is some amount of rejection for them to say no. To
   say no once is all right (hence 1 RP -- a small value), but to say
   no multiple times adds up.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>One-on-one outings: </I></B>Ahh, we come to the most
awkward, most RP-sensitive invitations.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If the person refuses your invitation without giving a reason,
   assign 15 RPs. (If they don't even bother to tell you why, then
   they deserve it.)</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person refuses your invitation, but offers a reasonable
   alternative, and sticks to it and the alternative event happens,
   assign -5 RPs -- they are showing an interest by offering an
   alternative.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person accepts your invitation at first, but then
   declines without a good reason within an "ok" amount of time
   before the event, assign 2 RPs. Changing one's mind is annoying,
   but since they gave you ample notice, it's not a huge deal.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person accepts your invitation at first, but then
   declines without a good reason at the last minute, assign 10
   RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person accepts your invitation at first, but doesn't
   show up, assign 15 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person accepts your invitation, and the event goes
   well, and they invite you to something in return, assign -15
   RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person accepts your invitation, but they seem bored,
   distracted, or annoyed during the event, assign 4 RPs.</LI>
   
   <LI>If the person accepts your invitation, and the event goes
   well, but conversation is limited to surface issues, add 3 RPs. On
   the other hand, if conversation is "deep" in your eyes, add -3
   RPs.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>The past experience option:</I></B> If you so choose, you
may want to weight your RP&nbsp;assignments based on past experience.
This can go either way. If someone has a low rejection
ratio&nbsp;(RR)&nbsp;in your life, meaning they do not normally
reject you, and they reject you this time, perhaps they should be
given a break. On the other hand, if a pattern develops, the
RR&nbsp;possibly should be inflated moreso, because one who goes from
good friend to continual rejecter probably should have a high RR.
Now, if someone has a high RR&nbsp;in your life, you may think twice
before lowering it by a significant amount (maybe it was a fluke).
However, depending on the situation, maybe they have had a change of
heart, in which case the RR&nbsp;should be deflated moreso, since the
person is taking a new interest in you for some reason.</P>

<P>There you have it....my initial guidelines for a "rejection ratio"
index that you can assign to all your friends and enemies (and they
can assign one to you as well). Now you can have a number to gauge
just how rejective the people around you are (or aren't), and maybe
that number can give you ammunition for saying things like, "You're
always too busy for me, you cat washer you." Enjoy, and don't be too
evil with your new-found categorization abilities.</P>
