<P>I went to a leadership planning meeting tonight. The general topic
of leadership reminded me of some thoughts I used to have on
leadership and such, the sorts of thoughts I still have in the back
of my mind.</P>

<P>To begin with, I've never felt much like a leader, even though I
think I&nbsp;have some good, creative ideas for how things should be
done. The problem, is, I believe, that my ideas are weird. I tell
weird jokes, I say weird things that aren't jokes, and I think weird
things. These often aren't bad things...just different, and one of
two things is true: 1) My weird ideas are ideas that are completely
my own thinking and it's not appropriate to expect anyone else to
support them; or 2) my weird ideas are good ideas that are just out
of place in the don't-want-to-be-bothered-with-something-different
culture they are presented in. Figuring out which of these two
possibilities is the correct one is a difficult problem. It's also to
be considered that a large part of the success of an idea is how well
it is communicated to interested parties -- and that form of
communication (often on the spot, in person, vocal communication) is
something I've not been very good at, and it may be true that an idea
that's only on paper is an idea that is easily ignored. :-) Finally,
it's not to be ignored that I really don't have a lot of experience
in "I told you so"ness. What I mean is that I don't have a
tremendously long track record of how great my ideas were in the
past, whether they were brought to reality or not. So that makes it
more difficult to determine what's a worthwhile idea and what's just
a "sounds good to Joe" idea.</P>

<P>I think a basic idea of a good leader could be a twofold
description something like "someone who has good ideas and someone
who has the charisma to convince others that the ideas are good
ideas". There's my problem, I suppose. I&nbsp;may have the first
part, but not the second. I have the traits, so I'm told, of being
softspoken, meek, and several other similarly bittersweet terms. So I
don't have the drive in me to force my ideas on other people...I may
whine and complain when my ideas are ignored, but that's usually the
extent of the reaction.</P>

<P>In connection with this, some people tell me that I let people use
me, something that is obviously not a good trait, and not a trait of
a good leader. How does this come about? I think it comes about from
trying to please people. It comes about because I want people to get
along. It comes about because I'd like for everyone to be happy. It
comes about because I try to consider everyone's "feelings" in
decisions. It comes about because I'd like to think that one person's
success does not need to come at someone else's expense. So with all
that sappy stuff, I end up not being very forceful, and tend to just
live with stuff and complain quietly to myself rather than make a
scene in public and stand up for things. I suppose Mr. Pyschologist
Joe could also see in that an attempt to avoid rejection, since
people are less likely to reject you if you never "rock the boat" and
counter what they want or expect.</P>

<P>So how does the softspoken guy with ideas that seem good to him
find some sort of leadership balance? I'm not really sure. I suppose
I'll continue to present my ideas in a nice but "we should do this"
manner, and maybe people would agree with me that some of my ideas
are worthwhile and wise. As a sort-of aside, I think it's important
for leader-type people to treat as one of their top priorities the
opinions of the led. There are times when those opinions need to be
overruled, but this should be done with caution. If the followers
have a brain (which, let's see, most humans do), then their feelings,
their opinions, their recommendations and complaints should carry
weight. It all comes back to the "walk a mile in their shoes" line
(not, by the way, the "assume what it would be like to walk a mile in
their shoes" line). I'm a bit fond of surveys to gather public
opinion. There are some problems with surveys (like what if the
majority of people don't like my good ideas!!), but they are a
valuable tool in many cases.</P>

<P>Those are my brief thoughts on leadership. As I take on more
leadership-type roles, perhaps my thoughts on the topic will become
more refined or even perhaps more traditional. Or maybe because I'm
dumb and write honest stuff like this I'll never be given those true
leadership roles. I'm not sure, and I'm not sure that I really care.
There is value in being able to speak my mind, whether that be in a
leadership role or as an exercise of "observe the state of things and
comment from the perspective of a commoner".</P>
