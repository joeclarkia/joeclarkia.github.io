<P><I>Today I found myself writing a longwinded email to some close
friends. It ended up being fairly wordy and fairly thought-provoking,
so I thought I'd share it with the world. The world will be so
blessed... I've added a little helpful text in places to make it more
understandable to the general audience (general topics in brackets).
:-)</I></P>

<P><B>&#91;spiritual attitudes&#93;</B> Yep, I think you're right
that we have a negative spiritual attitude. The question is, are we
somewhat objectively commenting on the true state of life, or are we
creating our own kind of self-fulfilling prophecy (as in, if you
expect evil or boredom or aloneness you're likely to find it)?</P>

<P><B>&#91;God's power and involvement in our lives&#93;</B> I think
I'm too...unaccepting or something. While I think that God can and
does control the "coincidence" moments of life, I don't put a lot of
stock in them, because they are, possibly, just coincidences. What I
and probably lots of people would like to see (strive to see) is
God's acting in my life in an unmistakable way. The definition of
what unmistakable is is the slippery issue. I think unmistakable
would be going on a road trip with God -- as in God in the seat next
to me. But you see how often that happens. So I must have faith, and
accept that God doesn't do that in-the-flesh stuff much anymore. I do
have faith, but I will be first to admit that I don't have an
overwhelming logical reason for it, other than that I choose to. I
mean everything in life leads me to believe that what I believe is
true, but there are few if any things that would completely convince
me were I not to choose to believe it.</P>

<P><B>&#91;Campus Ministers&#93;</B> I think they may be a little
more simple-minded, but not by accident. I think they are smart, and
they talk to lots of people, so they know the issues people have.
They have thought about them I'm sure, and have gotten past them. We
have kinda gotten past them, or more correctly just laid them aside
without really finding good answers for them. Thus we are in a more
precarious position in some ways, and I suppose a product of that is
that our faith seems (and probably is) weaker.</P>

<P>Now, there are the pragmatic things of faith too. "Faith comes by
hearing..." I for one will admit that I don't spend as much time
doing Bible reading and "thinking about God" as I used to. My Bible
reading time sorta turned into prayer on the way to work, but
otherwise my work day and school work and {blah blah blah} take up
too much time, and this intense focus on God (what there was of it)
has been diminished lately (where lately is the last 6 months or so
at least).</P>

<P><B>&#91;about Friesen, the "no individual will of God"
theorist&#93;</B> I'm more or less okay with being a Friesenite,
partly because it seems like the path that works in real life, and
partly because, well, I can be lazy. Stupid me for being lazy all the
time. What I mean is...I don't have to listen very much, I don't have
think about it much, I can just let life happen and not worry so much
about "What if God sends me to Africa?" I don't think he will, but on
the other hand if he does, and does so CLEARLY, I think it would be
okay(ish). What I do want and strive for and yearn for and wish above
all things is more...informal...involvement by God. Yes, I want God
to direct me. Yes, I want to know his power and great glory. Yes, I
want to know the knowledge of the eternal. But also, I think it would
be "cool" to go...watch hot air balloons with God. I don't say that
to bring God down, or elevate hot air balloons (punny). I don't think
I'd be thinking about balloons much with God in the car. But it's not
a formal, "let's pray and wait on the Lord" experience -- it's
experiencing God in the midst of real life, and not just so he can
tell me what to do or help me memorize Scripture or help me know how
to witness to someone. This has something to do with spiritual life
being a wholistic thing. God is a piece of my life, not meaning that
he's a small or insignificant piece, but I'd like God to, in real
terms, share my life with me. I wish he (or anyone for that matter)
would be excited about Java code or ATM Adaptation layers. It's
somewhere between a buddy-friend (too flip and silly) and being 1800s
`God` (too rigid and "out there" and ethereal). How's that for
post-modern?</P>

<P><B>&#91;The search for significance&#93; </B> Well, as I
aforementioned I'm lazy. And, I "feel" like God has placed me where I
am. I take some comfort in the hope that I can do something
significant from where I am. It's a question of talents. For me, yeah
yeah, it's computer stuff. Is that really, really, truly truly a
spiritual-ish gift? I wonder about that. I mean, does setting up
computers for people really count for something? Well, it's a helps
ministry -- you could compare it to carpenters. But generally
speaking carpenters are *essential*, whereas computer setter uppers
are convenient benefits, but not truly necessary. So, I like to think
that my ministry is computer stuff, and I hope that that's
significant. ... Beyond that, being a beautification engineer and all
that means that I don't want to just be a computer geek and junk, but
life is supposed to be about more than that. I may talk about ATM
Adaptation Layers, but that's not really where my true self lies. I
want to be smart or something and know stuff and do stuff, but I want
to be more than that too... I want to have some kind of influence on
people that goes beyond, "I fixed your Windows XP." Working as an
engineer and living at home can help in that regard to some extent,
as I can donate more money and such to worthy causes. On the other
hand, things like traveling for work mean that I can expect to be
taken away from my usual place of ministry at least occasionally...of
course I should still be able to minister wherever I'm at. Anyway,
the search for significance is a hard topic and one that I guess
maybe I tend to ignore sometimes -- I just do my work and try not to
complain too much.</P>

<P><B>&#91;socialness&#93; </B>I don't know....I think lately I've
been more a-social than in the recent past. I mean, I still like to
talk to people and get together and watch movies and all, but, well,
I haven't done much of any of that lately. I've been busy, and people
find other things to do. When I'm not busy, I tend to be living out
my Linux fantasies of installing some software or some dumb thing, or
investigating the nature of a new USB pen drive -- whatever little
thing I find to experiment with. This asocialness is also partly
because there are less of my peers around lately, and those that are
around are sometimes boring (or I don't ask them to do things).
Several of the college ppl went back to school this fall, several of
them are too busy, several of them are guys who would rather go
hunting or play on their own computers; several of them are married.
So, when I am bored on a Friday night (if that happened), I
could....call someone up almost out of the blue and ask them if they
want to do something, which is not my pattern anymore, or....I could
play with a computer or something. I'm likely to do the latter,
because, again, I'm lazy. I like people, I don't always think they're
stupid, but I guess I'm also not in as much of a people mood as I am
sometimes. Maybe I will be when it gets to be Christmas season. :-)
(random thought).</P>

<P>Okay, that's about enough writing for one sitting. Are you tired
of the writing yet? Did it bless your life? Maybe... Well, happy
contemplations.</P>
