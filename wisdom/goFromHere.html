21st Century</FONT></CENTER>

<P>Throughout the ages of history, communication has been the
cornerstone of human existence.  For many thousands of years,
humanity&#146;s basic living unit was the tribe or small city,
usually a community of individuals who lived very close to one
another and to the natural world.  But over the past few hundred
years, this has changed.  Today, humans often live among a mass of
nameless people, a sea of humanity, and have lost touch with one
another and the natural world around them -- and in so doing have, to
some degree, lost touch with their own spirits.  This often causes a
sense of loneliness and even desperation at times in one&#146;s
heart.  Every person has a need for individual worth, and also for
love and friendship emanating from meaningful interaction with fellow
humans.  The Information Revolution, which has opened the doors for
regional and global communications, holds promise for helping to
fulfill these needs, even in this age of potential isolation.  With
the possibilities, though, comes a responsibility to act wisely -- a
responsibility that humanity may or may not be ready to accept.  Thus
the question of our decade, this first decade of the 21st century, is
"Where do we go from here?  How do we use the tools in our grasp to
foster communication and personal meaning?"  Responsibility in
technology can lead to a &#147;beautification&#148; of our personal
lives, but lack of responsibility can be the effective death of the
individual soul as well as society&#146;s collective downfall.</P>

<P>Perhaps the greatest and most relevant discussion of technological
advancement is in regard to the development of personal computers and
information systems over the past twenty-five years.  The rise of
personal computers has deposited one of the most sophisticated
gadgets in the human arsenal into the laps of almost everyone.  The
various applications of computer technology are still being explored,
but it is clear that they are the key to the technology of the 21st
century.  The information systems that networked computers have
brought into being are a source of hope and possibility for the
future.</P>

<P>It seems clear that the future holds great promise
technologically, but we have yet to answer some key questions. 
Surely our society is undergoing a technological transformation.  But
how will the changes affect us as individuals and as a society? 
Economically? Socially? Spiritually? The list of questions and
reservations is nearly as long as the list of possibilities.</P>

<P>In some sense we can simplify much of the human condition to 1) a
striving for social interactions among social beings, and 2) an
endless search for personal meaning and worth.  If these are, in the
end, the highest goals of humanity, how can technology, specifically
communications technology, be used to meet these goals?  It seems
clear that technology, if used in appropriate ways, can be of great
benefit in the social realm.  For example, when in the history of
humanity could someone from Iowa converse with those in South Africa,
Venezuela, and Japan, all at the same time, from a personal computer
terminal, even bridging the language barrier with translation
software?  Such correspondences are not fiction -- they are very much
a reality today thanks to Internet technology.  The key here is that
technology should never be an end in itself, but only a means.  A
great number of individuals have been involved in making video
conferencing technology (for example) a reality.  But the technology
itself is not the end product, at least in a societal sense.  The end
product is when friends, diplomats, or corporate partners can
communicate quickly and easily -- this is the truest goal.</P>

<P>Still, the second goal -- the search for personal meaning -- has
been left unanswered.  Can technology help in this arena as well?  I
believe it can.  As is often said in criticism of technology, it has
a tendency to be "noisy", to focus on details rather than overall
realities.  Quite literally, it tends to focus on individual pixels
and arrays of bits, rather than on the reality of the composite
image, which may be a beautiful sunset or starscape.  This example
shows a clear contrast between technology "in the small" and
technology "in the large".  Yes, technology IS about details --
without thinking in a modular sense, the complex systems used today
could never have been developed.  So thinking about bits and pixels
is necessary.  But once again, this is only the "means", not the end.
 The end is when an artist can bring forth a creation from his inner
self and share it with the world.  The end is when an author can
record her thoughts and have them broadcast to the widest possible
audience.  The end is when a distraught teenager contemplating
suicide "surfs" the net and finds a web site or chatroom devoted to
uplifting the brokenhearted.  The end is when friends and family can
remain in touch via email and instant messaging programs.  The end is
when one can find solitude in the midst of the noise of technology by
looking at the "big picture" sunset, the artist's painting, or the
words of a friend.  And, to be sure, the end at times is when the
individual is free to turn the technology off, to find meaning in a
real sunset, a visit to an art museum, or a face-to-face
conversation.</P>

<P>So where do we go from here?  What should be our goals as we enter
the 21st century, with technology looming over us as either a Godsend
or a curse? Obviously, technology can be used to harm and destroy --
history has proven that to be true.  Technology can be used to
promote class segregation, propaganda, and hatred.  But it need not
be this way.  In the truest sense, technology is not the main
concern.  It is how we use the technology in our grasp -- that is the
determining factor.  If we choose to use technology to dialogue with
those around us -- to better understand them, their culture, their
ideas -- then technology will be a means of bringing us closer
together, helping us carry out the goal of social interaction.  If
however, we use technology as a club to wield against those who are
less technological than we are, then we are acting in the traditional
human egoism and striving for first place.  If we use technology to
promote natural beauty through artistry and literature, with the
realization that sometimes the only appreciable representation of a
thing is the real thing, then we are using technology as a means to
adding value to our existence as individuals -- we have added meaning
to our life.  If however, we use technology as a means of
self-corruption, or we become so absorbed in it that there is no
escape to real people and the real world, then we are abusing the
systems we have developed and are treating technology as an end in
itself.  Where do we go from here?  The possibilities are manifold,
the right paths are few, but with wisdom and responsibility, the
technological age of communication can enhance our lives and our
spirits by bringing us closer to one another and closer to the
thoughts and feelings that help us find true personal worth.</P>
