<P>As I write this, I am on a flight returning to Cedar Rapids from
Dallas, the last leg of one of my now almost routine business trips.
As I&nbsp;reflect on the work done, I am pleased that we accomplished
what we did, but I am also a little distressed about my overall
attitude. I could attribute it to lack of sleep, but I&nbsp;really
got a fair amount of sleep -- usually at least as much as I get at
home. I could attribute it to the stress of travelling -- but this
Dallas&lt;-&gt;Cedar Rapids travel is not all that stressful anymore.
The best thought is that it is a product of frustration when things
don't work like I want them too, and while that's a valid
explanation, I don't know if it's a good excuse or not.</P>

<P>If you know me very well, you might say that I&nbsp;have a bit of
a split personality. From time to time I&nbsp;like to "think great
thoughts" and dwell on thoughts of joy and the ideal life and all
that good stuff, but I also complain a lot at work. Really, I guess
the two personalities are quite similar -- both are a symbol of my
striving for perfection, or at least my desiring to get my way. Can
you see the similarity between "Love me please" and "I love beautiful
sunsets" and "Write the software the way that makes sense to me"? All
three are about getting my way and pleasing me.</P>

<P>So, if I&nbsp;were to overanalyze my life, it would seem that I am
a whiner. I think my whining has merit, but the fact is it's still
whining. What really surprises me is that people still seem to see me
(I think) as a happy-go-lucky person, which is kind of the way
I&nbsp;want it to be -- not carefree to the point of not caring, but
carefree to the point of thinking in unique ways and being creative.
But if all I do is complain and say "stupid crud"&nbsp;a lot, what
will people think?&nbsp;I think if I say it enough, if I vent too
much, then they will eventually get tired of it and I will be more of
an annoyance -- more a liability than an asset, which is obviously
not the state I want to end up in.</P>

<P>On a related note, while I&nbsp;was waiting in the airport, I was
reading a section of the book "Everybody's Normal Until You Get to
Know Them" on the topic of conflict resolution. I realize based on
current experience as well as past experience that I'm not good at
dealing with conflict. I'm sort of passive-aggressive about it. I see
the passiveness the most when dealing with kids. I don't like being
the disciplinarian, so I will let them get away with more than I
probably should, although it annoys me....but if it goes on long
enough, I will get MAD, which is the other wrong end of the spectrum.
In either case, I'm not handling the situation appropriately. In
other affairs, in dealing with my adult peers, a different problem is
seen. The book was talking about how conflict resolution should be
(at least initially) between the 2 parties directly affected. But I
realize that many times in my life if I'm mad at someone I'll look
for a third party rather than confronting the person in question.
Here's one excuse: I think that I get along well with most people,
and if there are some people I don't get along with, then talking to
them more won't help. That's how it seems in my head, even though
that's not necessarily the case. And if the conflict were over a
specific problem, then it would be easier, but when I have conflict
it tends to be over personality types or things like that -- and
those kinds of conflicts are harder to solve, because it's not one
specific problem that can be solved.</P>

<P>I think a big part of this conflict resolution problem, just like
so many others, has to do with communication. I can see that
happening over and over in the work environment -- miscommunications
happen all the time, and the direct results of that are lost
productivity and more workplace conflict. I know that I need to
practice the skill of "active understanding" -- to not just assume I
know what someone is trying to say, but to actually take the extra
time to repeat back to them what they said in some way so I know that
I understood the statement. That's a surprisingly simple step that is
overlooked too often, at least for me.</P>

<P>So now I have a new label for myself. I am a miscommunicating
whiner. :-) You love me even more now right? Well, that's okay, you
don't have to love me more yet. But I do hope to think about these
issues more as time goes on, in the workplace and in the rest of my
life as well (but right now the workplace is the best ground for
testing in this area). Anyone have any more tips on the subject?</P>
