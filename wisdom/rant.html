<P>1/19/98</P>

<P>This is the tale of my attempt to install networking software for
Windows 3.1 on a Power Mac 6116 DOS Compatible (running a 486DX2-66
processor).</P>

<P>---</P>

<P>I began with a fresh Windows 3.1 and very little knowledge of how
to proceed from there.  The documentation for networking that came
with the DOS Compatibility Card was virtually nonexistent (shame on
Apple), and so I had no idea what I was really trying to do.  I
didn't know if Novell Netware was shareware or commercial (I still
don't for sure), but I finally found it on their website and
downloaded it.  Nowhere in any documentation did it say whether
Netware Client was freeware or commercial (shame on Apple, who
mentioned Netware, and on Novell, who didn't really specify what type
of software it was).  I also downloaded a specialized version of
Trumpet Winsock from my university, not really knowing if I'd need it
or not.  I installed it, and still didn't know what I was doing with
it (shame on my college for not providing much of any documentation
on it).</P>

<P>Well, like I said, I ran the installers on Winsock and Netware
Client, but still (of course), I lacked Windows networking.  As I
trudged through help file after help file, I saw many possible
answers, and tried many of them, but none worked.  I eventually
figured out (for myself -- none of the documentation actually said
this) that I needed to load, in this order, the ethernet card driver
(MACODI.COM for my DOS Compatible), the network software (Netware
Client), the ODIPKT.COM file (which mysteriously was named
ODIPKT2.COM, but of course the help files erroneously called it
ODIPKT.COM for some stupid reason), and finally WINPKT.COM.
Theoretically, once all these files were in the right order,
everything would work fine.</P>

<P>But of course an easy solution was unthinkable.  I did get the
drivers to load in this order, but still nothing worked.  I then read
some more, and saw that the text files NET.CFG, STARTNET.BAT, and
probably AUTOEXEC.BAT needed to be tweaked.  But, of course, there
was no mention of EXACTLY how to do this, or what parameters to put
on the command lines, etc.  They gave examples of vectors and
interrupts and a handful of other terms that didn't mean much, but no
real clue as to how to do it on my own, with my particular setup.
</P>

<P>I figured out that I needed to load some driver such as ne1000 or
ne2000 or some such thing, and the help files implied that such a
file would be found in the network software folder (NWCLIENT for me).
 But my NWCLIENT had no such file or subdirectory.  This is where I
gave up.  I found a phone number for Novell and called them, only to
find that it would cost me $200 to have them set up my system.
(Shame on Novell for even mentioning such an outrageous price for
performing a service that most likely would take 10 minutes for
someone who knew exactly what to do!)  Earlier I had called Apple
about the problem, but they were no help, either, since they no
longer give telephone support, at least not for free (The phone
number -- 1-800-SOS-APPL   -- seems now to be a joke, since you can't
get help by calling it -- shame on Apple for their total lack of free
customer support.)</P>

<P>I really wonder why I care about this stupid Windows networking.
At the beginning of my college career, when I first hooked my 6100 up
to the campus Ethernet, I installed Open Transport, turned it on, and
-- IT WORKED!!!  THE FIRST TIME!!!  No messing with stupid text
files.  I wouldn't have minded messing with IP addresses and such,
but I didn't even have to do that.  (Thanks Apple for making decent
software, unlike some other companies.)</P>

<P>So perhaps someday, when I am even more foolish and willing to
waste more than 12 hours on a project that shouldn't take more than
one, I'll attempt Windows networking again.  Or maybe someday there
will actually be someone who can write a decent help file or
technical support document.  Until then, I guess I'll just stick with
the MacOS networking, since it actually works when you turn it on.
</P>

<P>If I've offended any party, well, that's too bad.  You fight with
your computer for 6 hours and not accomplish anything sometime and
see if you're a happy camper.</P>
