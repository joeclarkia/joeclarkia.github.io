<P>So I&nbsp;had an eventful weekend, involving sleeping in an
immobile car under the stars several miles from Clear Lake, Iowa. I
wanna tell the story, but I feel the need to talk about something
else tonight, something even more annoying than being stuck in the
middle of nowhere without a car that runs.</P>

<P>So, many of you are aware that given the right mood and the right
inspiration, I&nbsp;have this habit of writing longwinded "honest"
emails at choice points in my path of life, or starting "honest"
conversations about difficult topics. I wrote one such email tonight.
Not terrible, but I&nbsp;saw it (and with it my life)&nbsp;laced with
a badness that I'm only beginning to realize: manipulation.</P>

<P>I don't remember at the moment where this idea came from in my
mind, but I've been thinking for the last week or so about how
honesty (my form of it anyway) can and IS&nbsp;manipulative. I'm all
about saying what I think. I'm all about wanting other people to know
me. When pressured, I suppose I do hold back some, but I try to be as
transparent as possible. But with this honesty comes some amount of
manipulation I think, some expectation that people will respond to
honesty in the way that I think they should. And in my high-minded
idealism I have this expectation (ie how people should respond, not
necessarily how I&nbsp;think they will) that people should respond to
honesty in kind with honesty, and I have the expectation (again the
opinion of how people should respond) that people will agree with me
or at least understand what I'm saying and not chastise me for
thinking completely wrongly.</P>

<P>So, I am ready to admit that I'm a manipulator. I&nbsp;think it
has a good deal to do with why people enjoy my company but keep me at
arms' length. I am, I&nbsp;think, seen as an interesting person, and
a useful person at least in some ways (computers bleh), but someone
to be careful with at least on some level. And if I am a manipulator,
they have every right to be so careful. I am saddened that in all my
attempts to be honest and all that that it really might just be a
selfish attempt to make people agree with me or like me or whatever.
If this is confirmed more, it will be an opportunity for me to say
LIFYSO (Lord I fail you so often) and think that my whole paradigm is
wrong. Now having said that, I don't expect to go crazy searching for
a new paradigm. But what I would need to do is try to reconstruct my
paradigm in a non-manipulative way. You know, "speak the truth in
love" where the love is not tainted by selfishness and manipulation.
I feel a potential New Year's resolution coming on.</P>

<P>So, the baddest badness is that this manipulation is
self-reinforcing. I want to figure out more about it, so what do I
do? I talk to select people about it, all the while thinking that my
talks and emails and wise thoughts may be just as manipulative as I
always am. Clue for me! But I send my emails anyway, and write my
wise thoughts, and say what I think. Am I exercising my joy of
honesty, or am I exercising my skills of manipulation? I&nbsp;really
don't know for sure, but I&nbsp;have my suspicions now. I await some
more clear confirmation I guess, but I'm afraid of what the answer
will be if people really told me the truth. I am afraid of how I live
now, and I'm afraid because any attempt to solve the problem with
help from anyone except God would seem to only be emphasizing the
problem even more. I've seen this problem before (it's in another
wise thought somewhere I&nbsp;think), but never labeled it as
manipulation before.</P>

<P>Some days the thoughts are just cruddy. Bleh.</P>
