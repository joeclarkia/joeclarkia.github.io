<P>I would like to take a few paragraphs to discuss the idea of
perceptions.  Today, I am especially interested in what is and isn't
communicated when someone speaks, particularly over the telephone.
</P>

<P>The people I call on the phone fit into three categories:  those I
don't know (like most business calls), those I know well (close
friends), and those that are acquaintances.  For those in the first
or second category, it isn't really that tough to make a phone call. 
What troubles me is those from the last group.  Take for example
friends from my high school that I don't know all that well and
haven't talked to for several months, now that I'm in college. 
Before I make a call to one of these "long-lost friends" I go through
a mental struggle with questions like:  "What will I say?"  "Will
they want to talk to me?" and "Why do I want to call them, anyway?" 
If I have a reason to call someone, then it's easy to call them, take
care of the business at hand, and then if small talk pops up, then
that's great, but if not, it's easy to hang up and feel like I've
accomplished something.</P>

<P>But it's another story entirely when there is no outward reason to
call.  If I do call, there is certain to be the question in the mind
of the receiver, "Why is he calling me?"  In addition, I, the caller,
always wonder what the response to an unnecessary call will be.  It
may be favorable ("I'm so glad he called"), or unfavorable ("Oh, him
again."  &lt;Sigh&gt;).  Either way, there is likely to be little
outward evidence of the receiver's thoughts about the phone call,
and, indirectly, about me.  If they're glad I called, they may say
so, or they may not...it's hard to tell for sure.  And if they wish I
wouldn't have called, then if they have an amount of "tact" they
probably won't tell me to go away or hang up.  So the outward
difference between a cherished phone call and one that makes me seem
foolish in their eyes is very little.  People (including myself, I
suppose) are very good at hiding what they really think.  Maybe
that's good...maybe that's bad.  I suppose there are signs that show
what we really think -- the tone of voice, body gestures if the
conversation is face to face, etc. - but these "signs" are also
unpredictable, and you can't really judge someone for their tone of
voice, for example.  Maybe they just have a cold.</P>

<P>So it's hard to tell what people really think.  I can pretend to
know by just guessing, but that's setting myself up to be wrong.  I
suppose the best course of action is to ask outright what I want to
know (dumb as the question is), and I'll probably get a truthful
answer from most people with most questions.  But can you imagine a
phone conversation like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#AF0000">Hello?...Oh, hi.  This
is ____.  I thought I should call.  Are you glad I called?...</FONT>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Maybe I'm just weird, but asking questions like, "Are you glad I
called?" without any warning seems strange.  And I can't tell if, by
asking a question, I'm going to make the receiver even more biased
about the fact that I called.  If they really wish that I would go
away, and I ask, "Are you glad I called?", what are they going to
say?  They might bend the truth somehow, but in their mind they are
probably going to wish <I>even more</I> that I'd hang up and leave
them alone.  So trying to figure out the right words to say and right
questions to ask is important, but often in my case I end up saying
something stupid, because I can't think of the right words fast
enough.  And by saying something stupid, I make myself seem even
sillier for calling in the first place.</P>

<P>I suppose there is only one issue yet to be discussed:  the whole
notion that it matters very little what other people think.  In this
situation, that means that it's silly to think too deeply about
something as simple and innocent as a phone call and the way it can
change the way I'm viewed by others.  But I'm not sure the "I don't
care what anyone else thinks" slogan works here.  It may work for
total strangers, but for acquaintances and friends, I do think of
what they think of me.  I want people to respect me and even like me
(if I'm worthy of it, of course)...not for anything greater than what
I am, but for just that...for what I am.  I would like to think that
that's normal.</P>

<P>Well, if you think this topic is so minor that devoting a page or
two to discussing it is silly, well, thanks for reading my silliness.
 But I hope it inspires "deep and profound" contemplations.  Or if
not, I thank you for at least reading the thoughts from my "soap
box."  And I welcome
