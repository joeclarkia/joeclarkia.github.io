<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Is there any value in reading the Old
Testament?</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In the realms of popular Christianity, at times the comment is
heard which goes something like this, "Why read the Old Testament?
The stories are fables, the wars are gruesome, the rules are harsh,
and the ideas are stale with the passing of time." Is this true? What
can be said about this? I believe that there is indeed value in the
Old Testament, for several reasons. Let me share just a few with
you.</P>

<OL>
   <LI><B>The Old Testament chronicles the beginnings of all things
   and gives insight into ultimate purpose.</B> "In the beginning,
   God created the heavens and the earth." Those few words, and the
   others in the book of Genesis, tell the story of the start of all
   things: the universe, the earth, the natural world, humanity, and
   God's interactions with the world. Paradigms are set. God created.
   God chose to relate to mankind. God gave freewill. God chose to
   still pursue mankind, even after the Fall. These profound truths
   affect us every day. They are foundational to much of our
   collective thinking for the past 6000 years. Truly understanding
   where we come from is important to where we are and where we are
   heading, and we cannot see the past clearly without looking to the
   Old Testament.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><B>The Old Testament gives historical perspective.</B> It has
   often been said that those who forget the past are doomed to
   repeat it. Few doubt the importance of history. And when that
   history is shared by so many people (perhaps at least 1/3 of the
   world's population), it is all the more important. The writings of
   the Old Testament form the basis of belief for the Jewish,
   Christian, and Muslim faiths. Some of the epic stories found in
   the Old Testament are the creation, Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Ruth,
   David, the Psalms, Solomon, the corruption of the nation of
   Israel, the fall of Jerusalem, Daniel, Esther, and the other
   prophets. Sometimes these stories are "far out." Sometimes they
   are tragic. Sometimes they tell tales of love and devotion. They
   portray the full range of human experiences and emotions.  Someone
   in almost any condition can find a passage in the Old Testament to
   elaborate on their joy, their sorrow, their problem, or their
   victory. Everyone can learn something from these documentaries,
   and we sell ourselves short if we ignore them.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><B>The New Testament cannot be properly understood without
   understanding the Old Testament.</B> Looking through the books of
   the New Testament, it would be hard to find one book that does not
   refer back to the Old Testament. In the gospels, the Old Testament
   provides a cultural backdrop for the Jewish people and prophecies
   regarding the coming Messiah. In Acts, one can only truly
   understand the conflicts between the Jews and the Christians by
   understanding their similarities and differences that have their
   roots in the Old Testament. In the epistles, many times the
   authors make reference to the Old Testament (see especially
   Hebrews). The Story of the Ages -- of God's ceaseless pursuit of
   humankind -- is a timeless thread, and each part is important,
   from God walking in the morning mist in the garden of Eden to
   Abraham and Isaac and their foreshadowing of the cross, to the
   rise and fall of the nations of Israel and Judah, to the coming of
   God in the flesh in the New Testament.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><B>The Old Testament provides a fuller picture of the heart
   and nature of God.</B> Perhaps the most important reason for
   esteeming the Old Testament, a fact that is wrapped up in all the
   previous ones, is that the Old Testament shows us who God is. We
   see a number of things about God from looking into the Old
   Testament:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>God created humanity to reflect his glory and to enjoy
      living in His presence.</LI>
      
      <LI>God valued free choice enough to allow mankind to choose
      their path (unfortunately, we chose the wrong path).</LI>
      
      <LI>God did not leave humanity after the fall, but continued to
      favor us and work on earth as people looked to Him.</LI>
      
      <LI>God provided rules for life in the Ten Commandments --
      guidelines to order our life around.</LI>
      
      <LI>God's heart can be saddened by those who turn away from
      him, much as our hearts can be saddened by unrequited love.<BR>
      </LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P>These attributes of God or God's interaction with people on
   earth set the stage for God's work in the New Testament. Without
   the background information, the stories of the New Testament would
   still be true, but not as...complete.</P></LI>
</OL>

<P>With these ideas in mind, it should be clear that the Old
Testament plays a vital role in our thinking as Christians. But, no
honest look at the Old Testament would be complete without examining
some of the reasons that people raise the question we're looking at.
A couple of these were mentioned above, but here they are in more
detail:</P>

<OL>
   <LI><B>"The Old Testament is a book of stories...nice, but not
   true."</B> This is a frequently heard argument, and it's true that
   nothing in history can be proven 100% true. A measure of faith is
   necessary, but it is striking how certain things in the Old
   Testament have been declared "more probable" by recent
   archeological evidence, especially artifacts from the empires
   after the fall of Jerusalem.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><B>"The stories of the Old Testament show God to be a
   mean-spirited being bent on the destruction of innocent
   people."</B> This is another attack on the character of God. A
   quick glance at such things as God's guidance to Joshua to destroy
   the Canaanites and the prophets declaring doom for the wayward
   nations could in fact provoke one to think of God in a negative
   way. But a more balanced view upholds God's just, if not loving,
   nature in the Old Testament. In Deuteronomy 5:9,10, God states
   <I>"I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children
   for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of
   those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand
   &#91;generations&#93; of those who love me and keep my
   commandments."</I> So God might be seen as a rather strict Father,
   but not mean-spirited. Lamentations 3:32 speaks of God like this:
   <I>"Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is
   his unfailing love."</I> And in Ezekiel 16:8, God speaks of his
   love for His wayward people: "'Later I passed by, and when I
   looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread
   the corner of my garment over you....'" God created love, and God
   created justice, and their perfect balance is displayed throughout
   the Bible, although it's hard for us to see and understand at
   times.<BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><B>"The rules in the Old Testament are impossible to
   keep."</B> Well, that's true. God knew that when he made them.
   God's purposes in setting forth the Law are often debated. It's
   possible that they are specific laws for a specific group of
   people, and some of them only make sense in the context of ancient
   Israel. It's possible that they are a tool to show us our need for
   God by helping us realize that we cannot be perfect. In any case,
   I believe that the rules of the Old Testament, while they
   shouldn't be downplayed, should be balanced by a consideration of
   how those laws reflect God's character, first in their original
   context, and also for us today.</LI>
</OL>

<P>So, after these ruminations, what can we conclude? Hopefully, we
can conclude that the Old Testament is an important piece in
discovering who God is and how we relates to us and how we should
relate to Him. It's words are sometimes hard to understand, but I
believe taking the effort to read and understand the Old Testament
will prove very beneficial to our spiritual walk.
