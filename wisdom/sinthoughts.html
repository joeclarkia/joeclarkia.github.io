</B></FONT><B>11/30/99</B></CENTER>

<P><B>The following paragraphs are a discussion of some ideas about
sin, sin nature, the sinfulness of man, God's view of a Christian who
sins, etc.</B>

<P><B>We begin with a snippet of an article written by a professor
from Indiana Wesleyan University. The article deals with
homosexuality, but the main point (at least my main point) is more
general. Also note that the professor's comments are meant to be
tongue-in-cheek, as in he is actually disagreeing with what he
appears to be saying, and for the most part would agree with my
comments in the second section.

<P>1.  Sinners-in-recovery.

<P>All sin is of equal seriousness -- if you break one part of the
law you are guilty of breaking the entire law.  You have your sins, I
have mine....

<P>...cheaters and practicing homosexuals -- we do not recognize more
serious or less serious sinners.  So join the rest of us sinners --
we are a hospital of sin-sick people trying to get well with varied
success.   Join our church of recovering sinners.

<P>2.  Sinners-already-forgiven.

<P>Christ died on the cross to forgive all your sins.  If you are a
saved homosexual then God has already forgiven your sins -- even
thouse you'll commit tomorrow -- just keep confessing them.  Face it,
we all sin every day in thought word and deed, but for the Christian
sinner God cannot see these sins, for they were removed as far as the
East is from the West, more than 2000 years ago on a cross.  Your
homosexual sins along with all other sins are already forgiven.  When
you sin (for you will,  even St. Paul called himself the chaffiest of
sinners) your sin merely shows you the true state of your sinful
nature and the absolute purity of Christ. Keep your eyes on Him, for
you are clothes with His righteousness God can't see your homosexual
acts. Rejoice that there is therefore now no  condemnation to them
that are in Jesus.  God can't see your sin, rejoice that all your
sins -- past, present, and future were long ago wiped away.

<B>And now, here are my comments in response to the professor's
satire above. (Note that at this point I did not realize the above
was satirical.)

<P>Hello there.  About two years ago now, through the grapevine of
email I saw a column your wrote about sin and homosexuality.  I
thought it was worth a comment, since similar issues have been on my
mind recently.  I left enough of the original text to remind you what
I'm responding to.

<P>First of all, I always hear about the equalness of sins.  And I'm
willing to concede that I'm wrong in my thinking, but it's hard for
me to understand that.  I used to have a pet peeve of speeding (or
maybe it was just an example to use).  If speeding is wrong, then
it's a sin.  If it's a sin, we shouldn't do it.  But most or all of
us do.  And by this thinking, that's just as bad as if we all were
murderers...right?  Or, more tamely, it's just as bad to go 56 in a
55 as it is to 150 in a 55, by this line of thinking.  I know, it's a
difference between God's perspective and our own.  I realize the
origin of this idea is the fact that just one sin, no matter the
"severity", separates us from God.  But to say this "equal
seriousness of sin" around most people, I think, gives them the idea
of "Well, if it's wrong to speed a little or a lot or to lie a little
or a lot or to shoot someone with a water gun or a machine gun, I may
as well do as I please and not worry about the sinfulness of it,
since no one can escape sinning anyway, and it's all the same, so it
would seem."

<P>About saved from sin, once for all:  This sounds a lot like a
Calvinist/Arminian debate.  Seeing that you were from Indiana
Wesleyan, I was surprised at your comments on the subject (yes, I'm
making assumptions, but my assumption is that you hold to the
Arminian view that "once saved always saved" isn't true).  I have a
mental problem with the statement that "...we all sin everyday...but
for the Christian sinner God cannot see these sins..."  If God does
not see our sins, literally, then what's to stop us from sinning all
the more?  Sounds like that one verse of Paul's...I don't remember
his defense, but you'll probably repeat it for me.  But if even God
doesn't see (and supposedly doesn't care, then), why should we? 
That's rhetorical or something, but I'm sure I'm not the only one
thinking it.

<P>About our attitude toward sinning:  I've noticed lately how my
attitude about sinning differs from that of a lot of people.  I have
to preface this by saying that I'm a hypocrite, because I do sin a
lot, I suppose, in specific areas and just in general when I "mess
up."  But I don't think wallowing around in "I'm just a wretched
sinner saved by grace" and saying "Lord, I fail you so often" are
such great activities.  I am at the point now where I'm waiting for
God to show me that my thinking is wrong here, but it seems like we
should be "living above" the sin-ridden life.  On the other hand,
seeing that I do still sin, maybe I'm just trying to mask the effects
of sin...trying to deceive myself with talk of "living above" sin.  I
just don't see much hope in wallowing in the sinful nature, though,
and I don't think people like David or Paul are role models when they
fall, but instead when they remain standing.  Some people might look
at David's problems (for example) and find comfort that even the
great Bible leaders were human, but it only shows me that no matter
how strong my faith may be, it only takes a little spark of sin to
bring it all to ruin.  That's depressing, not hopeful, if you ask me.
 And, to relate this finally to what you said, I don't see how my
sinning shows me the purity of Christ.  Well, maybe in a way, but it
certainly doesn't show that to anyone else.  It shows them the
ineffectiveness of the transforming nature of Christ in my life...or
my unwillingness to allow the transformation, I mean.

<P>Finally, I'll reiterate.  If God can't see my sin, sure that's
good news for past sins, that forgiveness is a done deal, but what is
there to keep me from sinning all the more, if God really truly
doesn't see my sin?

<P>Okay, those are my thoughts on the subject.  I'd be interested to
hear your feedback.  Thanks for listening.  :-)
