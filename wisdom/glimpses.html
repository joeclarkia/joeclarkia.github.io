<P>Well here begins what may become a set of very serious, very
"heavy" wise thoughts from me. A week ago today my mom entered a
diabetic or liver coma that she has not yet emerged from. In all
honesty, the doctors say it is unlikely that she will recover from
this. This is not completely unexpected -- she has been in poor
health for a few years now -- but when things like this actually
happen, it's always tough.</P>

<P>Here's a bit more detail on my life story over the past week. As
my mom was entering this state, I was heading off on (yet another)
business trip to Dallas. This was the trip where we were to push our
project to completion for the demo that was to happen this coming
Wednesday. Well, we pushed hard, so hard in fact that even though I
knew about this situation at home it didn't seem "real" at the time.
But then on Friday our project got postponed, and all of a sudden my
priorities changed. Since the project was not imminent, I immediately
realized it was stupid for me to stay in Dallas when my family needed
me here in Iowa. So I returned last night.</P>

<P>Overnight and this morning at church, I was feeling surprisingly
unaffected by the situation. Now, I wasn't completely unaffected, but
I was not distraught by it either. I did start to have thoughts about
past memories and how things would be different in the future, and
one of the smart things I&nbsp;began doing was to record these
thoughts quickly....these "glimpses" of memory are worth preserving,
because they are a part of the "legacy" that my mom will leave
behind.</P>

<P>I went to see my mom this afternoon, and it was then that this all
really began to hit home with me. I still am handling it okay I
think, but there are moments when I realize that my life for the past
25 years is likely to change a great deal in just a very short amount
of time. I look around me, and so many objects and places and
activities have ties to my past..to my mom. I drive up 12th Street
near home, and it reminds me of the other 5000 or whatever times I've
driven this road, driving home to my home...and to my mom and dad. I
turn on the headlights on my car, and I remember the previous 200 or
whatever times I've turned those headlights on to depart from home
and from...my mom and dad. There are so many other slight glimpses
like this...here are some that I've written down so far (in no
particular order):</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">haircuts, gift wrap, packing, with family
   in Manchester, singing at GBC&nbsp;and Hillside, the speaker
   phone, Bible studies at 7th Day, Christmas lights, genealogy,
   rocking chair, glasses, shoes, hot air balloons at Amana, trips to
   Chicago to watch trains, at Aunt Gen's house, watching movies,
   YFC&nbsp;Junior Varsity, network hub holder, TV&nbsp;always on,
   Hillside issues, "Daisy a Day" song, gardens at Beverly and at
   home (this is a strong memory for me for some reason), talks with
   Grandpa Clark, high school graduation party, cataract surgery and
   watching trains out the window at Quaker Oats, sledding and
   hitting the house, elementary school volunteering, nature trail
   parking lot, when I broke the fish tank, pet parakeets,
   discussions on divorce, family research at Marengo, shopping at
   Kmart, waiting for Dad to get home from 2nd shift work, eating
   after Sunday church, watching trains after Sunday church</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These glimpses are some of my most treasured possessions during
this time, and I'm sure the list will only grow as time goes on and
as other stimuli remind me of other things in my past.</P>

<P>What I find interesting (but to some extent obvious)&nbsp;is that
there seems to be a correlation between what aspect of life I'm
thinking about and how much the situation at hand affects me. When
I&nbsp;am thinking about work topics or something where I&nbsp;really
don't have a memory of Mom associated with it, I&nbsp;am all right.
(This hasn't been the case for all bad times in life, and it may not
be the case for this situation either as time goes on.) But even
concerning work, I&nbsp;had this premonition tonight that I'm going
to call home from work tomorrow, and the fact that I know my mom
won't answer the phone is going to throw me for a loop for a moment.
It's the little pangs of loss like this that I think are a big part
of the grieving process. As I go through this time, I want to
document many of those "pangs", because I think they are worth
recording...they are glimpses of my life, glimpses of my past,
glimpses of things that will change, glimpses of things that maybe
don't matter to anyone else, but they matter to me.</P>

<P>The most painful glimpses I've had are the ones that are filled
with regret. Thankfully I don't have a ton of regrets, but there are
some that weigh heavily on my mind. Here are some that I can think
of:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>I hoped to print out my wise thoughts archive (of which this
   page is a part now) so that my mom could read them, since she
   never looks at my web page. As it turns out, I never did that, and
   it makes me sad that my mom will probably never be able to
   understand me in all the fullness that these "wise thoughts"
   provide.</LI>
   
   <LI>I hoped that my mom would speak out her legacy on a set of
   audio tapes. I hoped for things like memories of her childhood,
   memories of the early years of marriage, memories of my childhood,
   and more current memories and experiences. These types of things
   are the heart of such ideas as "documenting one's life" which I'm
   realizing all the more now should be a key important goal of
   anyone's life. When this life is past, I at least want to leave a
   legacy that people can look at and understand me. I hoped to have
   such a legacy from my mom as well, but that's unlikely now, and
   that saddens me a lot. On the other hand, I still hope to piece
   together this legacy from those who knew my mom best -- my dad, my
   grandma, and other family and church members.</LI>
   
   <LI>I regret the fact that I'm lazy. My parents have been gracious
   enough to allow me to live at home after graduating from college.
   (I don't think I've ever mentioned that in my wise thoughts before
   -- sorry if I look like an immature kid person since I still live
   at home.) Since I've been living at home, how much have I helped
   out? The honest answer is very little. I have taken up space, done
   my computing stuff, done my work stuff...and that's about it. How
   stupid of me! Why am I not helping out with more chores, meals,
   and just general conversation and friendship? Of course I do talk
   to my parents, but I'm afraid that especially as time has gone on,
   I have spent more and more time in front of this impersonal
   computer, and less and less time actually connecting with my
   parents. This is a regret I'll just have to live with I guess in
   my mom's case, but with this regret I will also have the
   opportunity to change in the future (which is a lot harder than
   just admitting the regret).</LI>
</UL>

<P>I think that is a good summary of my glimpses thus far in this
journey. Already, I am being blessed by the outpouring of prayer and
sympathy from those that are and have been a part of my life,
particularly the members and former members of UBC in Ames and
Hillside and GBC in CR. To each one I am sincerely thankful and
grateful for their support in this tough time. I think I owe it to my
mom, to myself, to my family, and to everyone else to record thoughts
like this as some sort of legacy to my mom, or at least to my
memories of her and how I am dealing with this grieving process. I
can't say for sure, but I'm guessing you'll be reading more thoughts
like these as the days and weeks go by during this situation.</P>
