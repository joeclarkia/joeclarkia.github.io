<P><B>I would like to speak in generalities today, meaning that what
I say does not apply to everyone, and what I say of myself doesn't
reflect how I always think. But in times of generalization, the
generalizations seem to reflect everyone, and seem to be the way I
always think. So here goes.</B>

<P><B>I've noticed lately that I have a problem in my friendships.
Now my problem is this: the more I spend time with someone that I
enjoy spending time with, the more I enjoy the time spent with them,
and the more I want to spend time with them (there is a limit to the
growth of this, but we won't go into that). But the more time I spend
with someone, the harder it is to believe that they actually want to
spend that much time with me. (Thus the fact often is that the
stronger the friendship, the more troubling this problem is.) You
see, I have a problem with trusting people. People are, in general,
nice to you on the outside (especially if they are your friends, or
you wouldn't be friends for long), and so even if they were somewhat
disturbed by your presence (your continual presence, I mean), they
likely wouldn't tell you so to your face. That's my generalization,
at least. This is why in a hypothetical schedule change which
necessitates the cancellation or postponement of something to be done
with a friend, I'm never quite sure what the friend's internal
thoughts are, whether they are thinking, "Oh, that's so sad" and
feeling sad, or "Oh, that's so sad" and really feeling glad about it
in some way. And this also explains my jokes about being telepathic
and how great it would be -- since I don't always trust people to
tell me the truth, it would be comforting (or dissillusioning) to
know what they're actually thinking. I guess, to put it bitterly and
"mushheadedly," I doubt that people like me as much as they let on.
They might still love me (as a sibling in Christ they are committed
to that, usually), but that doesn't mean they have to want to be
friendly to me. Friendship and tough love is not always
synonymous.</B>

<P><B>This leads directly to a crushing load of bitterness, envy,
jealousy, and competition. I find myself observing people for the
sole purpose of trying to determine what their true feelings are
about me, because I'm too untrusting to believe what they actually
say and/or the friendship they've shown in the past. And at the
slightest perception in my head -- literally one wrong step or one
wrong word, in some cases -- I am saddened and jealous. How stupid!
What does that show? That shows that IF people really didn't like me,
they'd have a good reason for it. How would you like it if your
friends always doubted your friendship and commitment to them?
"What's goin' on inside of me? I despise my own behavior."</B>

<P><B>I have said for several years that I see selfishness as my most
prominent character flaw. And this to me is a clear-cut case of
selfishness. Feeling possessive...feeling the competitive desires
("Well, I'm better than him, at least" or on the other hand, "My
friend likes someone else better than me because my friend spoke 13.4
sentences to them and only 12 to me. I can't bear to go on.")...and
hating it all.</B>

<P><B>So the question is how to change this foolish attitude of mine.
I've tried telling myself to shut up, but that's not terribly
effective after awhile (you might say I have an abusive relationship
with myself). Obviously, it's not something that I can just say, "Oh,
today I'll be happy," and it'll all go away. Any true change in
attitude needs God's help as well as effort on my part....And
although I'd like to say that it depends at least to a small extent
on how other people act towards me, it really doesn't. It's my
problem, not theirs, and it's my responsibility to deal with it.</B>

<P><B>Anyway, that's all for today. Thanks for sharing my character
flaw with me. I hope you enjoyed it. :-) Well, I hope it gave you
something to think about, at least.</B>
