<P>I wanted to take some time to write down my thoughts about the
year gone by in my life and to think about what I can do to change
and improve my life in the new year to come.</P>

<P>For my review of 2007 I'm going to be brief, but here are some
topics that seemed to be recurring themes throughout the year:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Knowledge Management</LI>
   
   <LI>Community Building</LI>
   
   <LI>Gardening</LI>
   
   <LI>Running/Exercise</LI>
   
   <LI>OLPC (<A HREF="http://www.laptop.org">One Laptop Per
   Child</A>)</LI>
</UL>

<P>There were a few lines that seemed to be important in my thinking
throughout the year:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Keep moving forward.</B> (the Toyota theme, but also
   something I found personally inspiring)</LI>
   
   <LI><B>What are you for? </B>(as Christians people generally know
   what we are against, but what are we standing for, what are we
   hoping to achieve that is relevant to "the world"?)</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Where are we going from here?</B> (line from a Blackmore's
   Night song.. as the New Year's time has come, it's an appropriate
   question to ask. It's also appropriate as the end of 2007 has also
   come with a flurry of political discussion with the caucuses
   coming up shortly... those who are aware in the US are asking this
   question with respect to who will be leading our country a year
   from now.)</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><I>And now looking to the future</I></B>...</P>

<P>I think I've run across a lot of songs lately that have to do with
the future. "New Year" the Raphael J song which I've enjoyed at this
new year's time now for several years. More recently, I discovered
"The Clock Ticks On" and "Where Are We Going From Here" by the group
Blackmore's Night -- those songs seem to have set my mood this year
for evaluating the past and anticipating the future year. I think the
mood worked pretty well... here's what I've come up with...</P>

<P>First off, I think I&nbsp;like the word <B>goals</B> better than
the more usual word "<B>resolutions</B>." If you ask 10 people about
resolutions for the new year, I bet 8 of them will say something on
the order of "Eh, resolutions are stupid because nobody keeps them."
And so (at least from that line) because of rampant and expected
failure people don't set resolutions and (arguably)&nbsp;they miss
out on a chance to improve themselves or the world. Realizing this, I
choose to call my statements here "goals." I'm sure that I won't meet
the mark every day. While missing the mark is not ideal, it's
realistic to accept the fact and say, "Even if I fail, that doesn't
change my goal for the day(s) to come."</P>

<P>As I've been thinking the last week or so about this, I've come to
view 2007 as sort of a year of "productivity" and of trying to
organize groups to share information or to combine efforts toward a
common task. Productivity is still something that drives me, and
organizing people around causes is still important. But I think
perhaps I went overboard on it, at the expense of developing actual
relationships with people. You think? In any case, I think one of my
main goals in this coming year will be to develop stronger
relationships with individuals.</P>

<P>One of the things that always holds me back from developing
individual relationships is the fact that there are so many
individuals that I know. And with that I have to balance my time,
meaning that some people don't get as much attention as others. I
suppose this has always kept me from "focused friendships," because
I'm trying to play fair.</P>

<P>I think I see this phenomenon leading me in a couple different
directions this year (or maybe both). First, I may accept a little
more seeming unfairness so that I can concentrate on friendship
development. I don't mean shutting anyone out, just making day-by-day
decisions more carefully. We'll see how that works. (And feel free to
tell me that's a selfish goal if you think it is.) Second, if I get
convinced that playing favorites is selfish, then this goal will
morph into a "be all there" goal, meaning that I want to focus more
on the people around me.. more than I do now. This doesn't mean I
focus more on any specific people, but just.. if I'm talking to
someone, I should really listen and not be preoccupied by some other
random thing. FOCUS. That's the word.</P>

<P>Another aspect of this goal will be to not be afraid of my phone.
Okay, I'm not really afraid of it, but I don't like talking on the
phone all the time. And I still don't expect to call people all the
time to chat about nothing. But I also realize that there are a lot
of occasions for building friendships that I&nbsp;miss out on because
I'm too lazy to call people. I spend my life typing on xanga or
reading slashdot or whatever, and I could use that time more wisely,
investing it with people (real life people). So, I want to try and
refocus my attention on real people in real time. I want to be less
annoyed by driving somewhere at night to spend time with people, and
more quick to realize that time spent with people will probably
improve my life more than sitting around at home. -- Those thoughts
may be inspired by my current week of vacation, and when I get back
to work I'll have less time available, but... I think there's still
some truth to my thinking.</P>

<P>That being said, I think I just exhausted my store of "I must say
this" goals. I do have some other goals, but they're more typical.
Actually I&nbsp;think the reason I&nbsp;hesitate to mention them is
because they are the goals that I&nbsp;have, in my own estimation at
least, repeatedly underperformed on. But, here's to a new year and a
renewed hope for meeting goals:</P>

<P>I want a renewed spirituality. I guess there are a lot of facets
to that, and in some sense I just want to observe God do amazing
thing in my life and the lives of my friends. But I&nbsp;have to keep
up my end of things too, and I don't always do that. Hence the goal:
to put more effort into doing the daily things I should do to renew
my mind in God. This goal seems so simple, being something like
taking 10 minutes a day to read the Bible and taking time to pray and
perhaps some time to be silent and reflect. Surely I&nbsp;have that
much time in my supposedly busy schedule. The raw fact is that I
don't always want to put the time in. And that is what really needs
to change. So, in some sense I&nbsp;need God's help to start the
process of meeting this goal. Sound familiar to anyone?</P>

<P>Along with these goals, the other day I was thinking about
"recapture the moment" or "recapture the magic." I think those
sayings resonate with me right now. I want to enjoy and really
"savor" the moments of my life more than I do now. I want to have a
sense of "magic" working in my life -- not in a weird way, but in
some transcendent way, some ability to see that life is about more
than just the stuff I do and think on the surface, and that people
are about more than who I&nbsp;see them to be on the surface. If it
makes sense, this hard-to-state goal really has ties to both more
focus on people and more focus on my commitments to God. Or, more
correctly, the recapturing is part of what I&nbsp;hope to gain by
meeting my goals.</P>

<P>I also want a renewed commitment to "wellness" in its several
meanings. I have a sort of bipolar nature about wellness. I weigh
myself every day. I&nbsp;cook vegetable soup and eat it sometimes
because it's good for me (even when it's burned, ick). But, I also
eat pizza too readily and generally over-portion my meals. I am
serious about wellness -- except when I'm not. And that's not really
the place where I want to be. In a big way that amounts to
strengthening my discipline:&nbsp;to avoid temptations now to realize
a brighter future later. Although people may not realize it, I see
that my ability to stand up under some temptations is really not that
strong, and so that's something I want to focus on and improve in
this coming year.</P>

<P>So, there you have it. You might sum it up as "focus on individual
people, live a disciplined life."</P>
