<P>Joe, the self-proclaimed beautification engineer and constant
seeker and potential giver of love and good sentiment in its various
forms, is now accepting new applications for the position of
"valentine". The lucky winner can expect to receive a gift
symbolizing the specialness of a "valentine", as well as kind words
of affection.&nbsp;If the winner so chooses (and hopefully she will),
she will also get a backstage pass to the
comedic/cheesy/song-loving/complaint-laden/idealistic/beautification-oriented
"Joe Show". This backstage pass will consist of everything wholesome
and nothing immoral and may likely be renewed indefinitely.</P>

<P>Before signing up on this application, the following requirements
(written in typical engineerish language) need to be met:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>The Applicant shall be of the human female variety.</LI>
   
   <LI>The Applicant shall be single, where single means
   significant-otherly unattached.</LI>
   
   <LI>The Applicant shall enjoy the prospect of being a "chosen
   valentine."</LI>
   
   <LI>The Applicant shall plan to make use of at least one
   "backstage pass".</LI>
   
   <LI>The Applicant shall not be too busy and shall not ever use an
   excuse like, "I'm too busy; I&nbsp;have to wash my cat."</LI>
   
   <LI>The Applicant should share similar ideals in at least an
   exploratory fashion.</LI>
   
   <LI>The Applicant should share similar experiences, or be able to
   bridge the "experience gap" in some way.</LI>
</OL>

<P>If you are applying online, please provide details along with
preferred contact information to Joe at
<I>joeclark-at-iastate.edu</I>. If you are applying from a printed
version of this application, sign your name and provide contact
information on the included sign-up form. Pictures are always
welcome, but not required. Any other background information would be
welcome as well (please attach to the sign-up form).</P>

<P><I>Please note that if applicants meeting the requirements do not
present themselves, the "valentine" honor will be bestowed at will
upon a non-applicant of my choosing.</I></P>
