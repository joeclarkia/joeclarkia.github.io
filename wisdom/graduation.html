<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">Well, what are my memories of graduation? 
I've been a little slow in putting this page together, but now that
I've said I'd put it up, I'm going to go through with it and come up
with something to say.  Here goes....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">First of all, I would like to thank my
counselor and advisor, Mr. Wojtowicz, for all the work he put into
the graduation ceremony.  Apparently, it is his responsibility to
make sure that graduation goes smoothly, and I thought he did a fine
job of it this year.  I would also like to thank Mr. Wojtowicz for
being a great AP English teacher.  It was a great year, and I won't
forget it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">Next, I would like to thank my parents, who
put together my graduation party.  I told them, "You arrange it, and
I'll show up."  And for a while I feared that it would be "dumb." 
But it definitely wasn't dumb.  It was great in almost every way
(except when the little kids started putting bow ties in my hair, but
of course that wasn't my parents' fault).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">I would like to thank everyone who came to
my graduation party or who sent cards.  They were all very much
appreciated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">I enjoyed very much the time spent with my
fellow valedictorians Cindy, Jennifer, and Dana.  The three of us
spent several hours together coming up with ideas about our speeches
and just having a good time together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">Finally, I would like to thank everyone at
Jefferson - administration, staff, and students - for the
encouragement, knowledge, wisdom, and friendship they gave to me.  I
wouldn't be able to name everyone who holds a "special place" in my
heart.  Though I am moving on, I'll not forget you.  To those of you
who are part of the class of '97 like me, I'll miss you.  Let me know
how your life is going from time to time.  And a special note to all
of you who knew me and are part of the class of '98, let me say I'll
miss you too.  Jonathan, Shannon, Amanda, Erik, Karen, Nicole, and
everyone else - keep in touch when you can.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">Well, what else is there to say?  Only one
thing left, it seems.  With graduation and the completion of the Day
Care project, my job at the Cedar Rapids School District Board
Building (the ESC) in the Technology Department basically came to an
end.  Thank you to Russ, Gary, Sandy, Betty, Terri, Wendy, Scott,
Dixie, Larry, Denise, Tracy, and my co-co-op students Eric and Shay. 
(Did I leave anyone out...I hope not.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B1BFF">So, those are a few of my memories and
thank-yous about graduation.  To all of you who have shared a part of
this experience with me, please keep in touch with me at Iowa
State.</FONT></P>
