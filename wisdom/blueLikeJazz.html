<P>Lately I've been reading through the book "Blue Like Jazz" by
Donald Miller. I've found it to be an interesting read, and would
like to share some quotes with you from the book, and to encourage
some thoughtful dialogue on the topic with questions to follow. I've
also included a dissenting review comment I found online at
amazon.com.</P>

<B><I>"I believe that the greatest trick of the devil is not to get
us into some sort of evil but rather have us wasting time. This is
why the devil tries so hard to get Christians to be religious. If he
can sink a man's mind into habit, he will prevent his heart from
engaging God." </I>(BLJ, pg 13)</B></P>

<P>Do you agree with the implication that "religion" is often
associated with "habit"? Why or why not?</P>

<P>Do you agree that "wasting time" is a means of missed
opportunities as Christians (where "wasting time"&nbsp;is not limited
to the thoughts about religion per se, but including all the other
ways of wasting time as well)?</P>

<P>In what ways are we in Cedar Rapids, IA in 2005 most likely to
"waste time"?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"It is hard for us to admit we have a sin nature because we
live in this system of checks and balances. If we get caught, we will
be punished. But that doesn't make us good people; it only makes us
subdued."</I> (BLJ, pg 18)</B></P>

<P>Which do you find more often motivating your actions (not just
your thoughts): the desire to do good, or the fear of being caught
for doing wrong?</P>

<P>If it is true that the common idea is more about "not getting
caught" than about "doing right", how do we motivate ourselves to "do
right"?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"The problem is not out there; the problem is the needy beast
of a thing that lives in my chest." </I>(BLJ, pg 20)</B></P>

<P><B><I>"I talk about love, forgiveness, social justice; I rage
against American materialism in the name of altruism, but have I even
controlled my own heart?&nbsp;The overwhelming majority of the time
I&nbsp;spend thinking about myself, pleasing myself, reassuring
myself, and when I am done there is nothing to spare for the needy.
Six billion people live in this world, and I can only muster thoughts
for one. Me."&nbsp;(BLJ, pg 22)</I></B></P>

<P>Is this an evidence of the "sin nature"? </P>

<P>How does this "needy beast of a thing" idea reconcile with the
idea of sanctification?</P>

<P>Is the author being too hard on himself here? Or do the rest of us
just live in apathy?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"I pictured my pastor as a salesman or a magician, trying to
trick the congregation into believing Jesus could make us new. And,
honestly, I felt as though he was trying to convince himself, as
though he only half believed what he was saying. It's not that
Christian spirituality seemed like a complete con, it's just that it
had some of those elements."</I> (BLJ, pg 29-30)</B></P>

<P>Have you ever heard seekers (or Christians) say words such as
these? Have you thought such things yourself? What do you think and
say in return?</P>

<P>What does it mean to be made "new"? If the Gospel is
"transformational", what does that look like?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"My Sunday school teachers had turned Bible narrative into
children's fables. They talked about Noah and the ark because the
story had animals in it. They failed to mention that this was when
God massacred all of humanity."</I> (BLJ, pg 30)</B></P>

<P>What do you think about this statement?</P>

<P>If you were raised in a Christian setting, do you think your
upbringing "watered down" Bible stories to make them
child-friendly?</P>

<P>If the stories are "sanitized" to be suitable for kids, is that a)
just fine b) okay, I guess or c)&nbsp;very very bad?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"The magical proposition of the gospel, once free from the
clasps of fairy tale, was very adult to me, very gritty like
something from Hemingway or Steinbeck, like something with copious
amounts of sex and blood. Christian spirituality was not a children's
story. It wasn't cute or neat. It was mystical and odd and clean, and
it was reaching into dirty. There was wonder in it and
enchantment."</I> (BLJ, pg 35)</B></P>

<P>Do you think we tend to lose the "enchantment" of Christianity
with all our clich&eacute;s and typical ways of doing things?
Realizing that it is so easy to grow stagnant in our Christian walk,
is it a) a product of the way we do "church" and "God", b) a product
of our waywardness, or c) both?</P>

<P>Does it help you to consider that Christianity is not a children's
story? Or does the author's quote above not matter much in your
opinion?</P>

<P>Do you recognize a connection between the appeal of the "mystical
and odd" and the allure of other religions like Buddhism?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"'&#91;Believing&#93; isn't a decision....I can't do it. It
would be like, say, trying to fall in love with somebody, or trying
to convince yourself that your favorite food is pancakes. You don't
decide those things, they just happen to you. If God is real, He
needs to happen to me.'"</I> (BLJ, pg 53)</B></P>

<P>Do you believe this is true? How would you respond to a seeker who
said something like this?</P>

<P>Is this a Calvinist/predestination sort of mindset? What is the
Arminian/freewill/Wesleyan response?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"God has not been nor ever will be invented. He is not a
product of any sort of imagination. He does not obey trends...Don't
complain about the way God answers your prayers."</I> (BLJ, pg
92)</B></P>

<P>Do we have a true picture of the attributes of God? As hard as we
aim to see Biblical truth, do we still define God by our own
standards? Do we seek a God that will give justice, but not if it
means flooding the entire earth? Do we ignore (or
reinvent)&nbsp;portions of the Bible because they would challenge our
assumptions about God's attributes?</P>

<P>

<HR>

<B><I>"I&nbsp;said to a guy the other day, 'God bless you.' What does
that mean? I have been saying that stuff all my life, but what does
that mean? Then I started thinking about all the crap I say. All the
clich&eacute;s, all the parroted slogans. I&nbsp;have become an
infomercial for God, and I don't even use the product."</I> (BLJ, pg
97)</B></P>

<P>Do you share this opinion of Christian "slogans"? Or is the author
just messed up?</P>

<P>If you think the author has issues, how would you respond?</P>

<P>If you think the author has a valid point, what do you think can
&amp;&nbsp;should be done about the problem? Is it a problem for you
personally? In your friends' lives? In the life of this church?</P>

<P>

Some reader feedback:</P>

<P><I>"Nonreligious Thoughts? My thoughts on following Christ? I
certainly have no desire for those. I want my thoughts and views
shaped by something I can trust. I want them driven by Biblical
truth. My heart and mind are wicked. I cannot think correctly. I
cannot reason correctly. The only thing that is good for is to have
my mind renewed. My thoughts must be religious. They must be shaped
by the Word of God." </I><FONT SIZE="-1">(review comment on

<P>What value do you place in the spiritual thoughts or ideas
proposed by the following sources?</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the Bible</LI>
   
   <LI>pastors</LI>
   
   <LI>other church leaders</LI>
   
   <LI>popular authors &amp;&nbsp;books (such as Blue Like Jazz)</LI>
   
   <LI>friends and family members</LI>
</UL>

<P>Do you think that you personally have enough Biblical
understanding to discern when "thoughts" of others are in agreement
with the Word of God and when they are not?</P>

<P>Do you find that you "experience God"&nbsp;more in typical
"religious"&nbsp;settings or in other experiences in everyday
life.</P>
