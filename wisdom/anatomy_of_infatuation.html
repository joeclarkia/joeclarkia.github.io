<P>&lt;sigh&gt; I think I'm sick. I think I'm struggling not to fall
off my previously-mentioned slippery slope...oh, who hides from the
truth? I think at several recent moments I have been sliding down the
slope of infatuation, trying to steady myself and stop the descent. I
am experiencing a day, a week, maybe a month of infatuation, and as
I've been thinking about it and analyzing my observations, I see the
same patterns emerging as in my other few times of such infatuation.
What I want to share with you is, well, very personal, not in the
sense of it being a secret, but in the sense that it is *who I am*,
to one degree or another, on almost any day. It is normal me, taken
to an extreme. So, though often times I write in a sarcastic,
happy-silly way, this is not one of those times. This is a serious
one, so be ready. I hope this doesn't come across as too normal,
because infatuation for me is anything but what I consider normal,
and I hope that I&nbsp;can convey a bit of the "craziness" of it to
you...</P>

<P>In previous "sliding parties", I have refrained from writing about
the experience at the time, thinking that it was too connected to
real life, too dangerous to bring into the public setting at the
time. However, here's one thing I'm learning about the whole
infatuation deal: it's not really about the other person. I know that
it seems like it OBVIOUSLY&nbsp;IS about the other person, and yes of
course it is to some degree. But I think that the things I think
while on the slope are more characteristic of who I am than of who
anyone else is or how they respond to me.</P>

<P>First, I want to give an overview of what I see as the progression
of infatuation in the generic sense, and then later I'll get into
more specifics on this particular issue on my mind tonight. As I see
it, infatuation for me begins with a desire and an opportunity to
share "good sentiment" with the other person, who for generality's
sake we'll call "The Person". Sometimes this is an opportunity that
I&nbsp;have forged out of a fledgling desire, and sometimes it's a
desire that is borne from an opportunity in life (inviting people to
a party for example).</P>

<P>In either case, when infatuation begins, it begins as an idea that
perhaps there could be more than just an ordinary friendship. As the
friendship continues or increases, as long as it seems like the
conversation is growing, the infatuation continues. This is the stage
where I evaluate every word The Person says to look for hints of
requitedness and a return interest.</P>

<P>After that comes the initial disillusionment stage, when I realize
that though The Person is nice to me, they are nice to other people
too, so there's no inherent "specialness" to me. Thus the infatuation
is just wishful thinking. Note that this has no real basis in fact,
just assumption and uncertainty.</P>

<P>After that comes heavy disillusionment, when I realize that my
possibilities are really all just wishful thinking, and dreams that
are just out there and random. It is probably also here that I begin
to realize that this isn't really about the other person, but about
me, and what I want, and what I feel like I never get, and about the
envy I feel when I realize (assumption) that I'm not special in their
eyes.</P>

<P>Then comes the up-and-down stage, where I am sometimes free
(FREEDOM!!!), sometimes not, from the feelings. This is the
reactionary stage I suppose, where my mind and spirit coordinate to
try to extricate me from a scary situation. But the fear is
intoxicating, and the hope exhilarating, and so the up-and-down stage
is typically not the end of my infatuation.</P>

<P>The up-and-down stage is the place where the analysis occurs in a
huge way. What do they really think? What do I want? Do I know what I
want? What if...? What if not...? This is when my priorities really
start to suffer, when everything that normally inspires me begins to
seem drab, and the parts of life that are just "ho-hum" anyway are
nearly *intolerable*. With so much supposedly at stake in my life,
with God perhaps about to move and bless my life (well, at least a
very slim glimpse of a chance), the normal everyday things of life
seem quite honestly annoying and somewhat pointless. It is
interesting to note, then, that the word here is hope. Hope, my
constant traveling companion, the thing that makes me a
beautification engineer and that gives me joy in my journey, is also
the thing that torments me with what might be, what could be, what I
should strive after. This is one focal point of my "disease". It is a
cancer of hope, a dangerous uncontrolled growth in my mind and
heart.</P>

<P>This is also when I complain about honesty and how backward it is.
I so much long to speak my mind and just tell The Person about my
feelings, but from precedent I feel like that is just about the worst
thing to do. Hidden feelings are hard for me, but open feelings are
hard for both people. With hidden feelings the other person might
possibly not notice my foolishness, but there's no doubt after
I&nbsp;say it. And there is always that moral high road of "honesty
is the best policy" which is made way questionable by situations like
this.</P>

<P>But as these thoughts progress, they seem to always come to the
same conclusion. Hope drives me toward exploring all possibilities,
no matter what the difficult outcome may be. Even when I sense that
the hints I give are largely ignored or avoided (which implies a
greater "punishment" in the end), I still want to know for sure -- I
still want to be sure that I didn't miss the opportunity.</P>

<P>So, usually, hope propels me to disclosure and its inevitable
conclusion of, "You're a nice guy, but I'm not interested" You the
reader may argue about the inevitability of it, but it's 100%
accurate for me, and I am bitter about that. I do not intend to be
bitter at God or bitter at life or mad at people or hate life or
dis-enjoy life because of it, but I am still very bitter that I am
always the good guy, the cheesy guy, the smart guy, the respectable
guy, the silly guy, the weirdo guy, and whatever else....but never
the romantic guy who gets love returned for this cancerous hope.</P>

<P>After that stage comes the messy part of awkwardness and trying to
clean up the mess I've made with my exposed tumor. It usually takes a
rather long time, but it does have more than one outcome. In some of
my cases, it has led to a fairly happy continuation f friendship
(well, friendships that currently have dissipated to some degree over
time, to be honest). But in some other cases (about half), the
"chemotherapy" of the honesty returned by The Person is to some
degree debilitating. I cannot even really describe the "anguish" of
it. Anguish may not be the right word, but it seems right at the
moment, and it's my paragraph, so I'll use that word. :-) It's a
sadness, and a bitterness, and a hope-broken-ness and a continued
reversal of priorities all in one. It's even a little bit of
self-arrogant thought that says, "What? I offer something to you, the
chance to know my thoughts to a depth that only you have the
privilege of seeing, and you reject that? I have this keen sense of
beauty in life, and you dismiss it as somebody else's fantasy? Stupid
People!" And then sanity returns and I am reminded that my beautiful
sunset dreams are forged just as much out of the evil bitterness as
they are out of the true beauty of things, and that reminds me that I
am not nearly so much a treasure as I might think I am, because of
just such liabilities as this whole train of thought tonight and the
instability it shows in my thinking. ... In any case, I've learned
that the happy-Joe key to being a successfully post-infatuated person
is to bounce back from the hopelessness as quickly as possible. And I
do bounce back, sooner or later, with another data point on my
spectrum of The Person's responses ranging from, "You are so
annoying, leave me alone", to "You scare me with your dreams,
I&nbsp;must go wash my cat now", to "It might have been, but I was
wrong, sorry."</P>

<P>That, my friends, is pretty much the full spectrum of infatuation,
in all of its gory detail. Here are some interesting considerations
when thinking about this topic:</P>

<P>* what I'm calling infatuation here could in another light be seen
as getting up the stinkin' nerve to ask someone on a date. I&nbsp;can
wish all I want, but more often than not I drive myself into complete
impossible situations rather than just ASK ALREADY&nbsp;and be done
with it. Am I&nbsp;stupid, or am I stupid? "Don't get too attached",
I think, or typically I want to know more about this person (and how
likely they are to reject me) before I go commit myself to them for
-- well, 2-3 hours on a date, or something. But before I get the
nerve, if I&nbsp;happen to like them I do this whole infatuation
thing instead of just asking. How foolish is that? And once begun the
whole process tends to just reinforce itself, or at least it seems
that way in most of my experiences. "God help me!"</P>

<P>* This reminds me that I feel a lot of times like people don't
listen to me. When in most groups, I have learned to say stuff and
contribute fairly well, but I'm not usually the most talkative one.
For sure, on the more personal topics I&nbsp;probably have an opinion
but often would seek out a small group or (in this case)&nbsp;a
one-on-one audience to share it. But the one-on-one conversations are
hard to come by, and even interesting people can steer conversations
away from the "heart"&nbsp;of matters more quickly than I'd like. I
wish that people would track with me in conversation without me
having to steer them back by force. I wish people would take the hint
from my wise thoughts and emails and ... I don't know ... sympathize
with my life, and either chastise me or support me. But usually, I
don't hear responses from these wise thoughts, just maybe a line or
two, "It was good." Yeah, that's profound. Who will share this joy
with me in sharing my thoughts, both good and bad? Who will uphold my
hope and participate in my dreams? I know that "only God can
satisfy,"&nbsp;but play along with me on this one, okay?</P>

<P>* I wish other people were more honest. Here I&nbsp;am, the
infatuated hiding-the-truth one, wishing for honesty, but oh well. I
wish that people would just say what they mean and get it over with.
I mean, I bet The Person would figure out sooner or later that I'm
acting weird. So confront me! Tell me to back off. Tell me that my
hopes are misguided. Or tell me they aren't and make my day. But I
think people don't act like that. If they're interested by some magic
chance, they'll say, "Well, I'm interested, but he has to take the
initiative." If they're not interested, I bet they think, "Okay, Joe,
you're being weird. Don't make a scene. I'm going to carefully
overlook your implications, and maybe you'll get over it and not open
up your heart and reveal that tumor that I&nbsp;sense is hiding
there." If people don't think like this -- well, I'd never know,
because they never say.</P>

<P>* Finally, I wonder who will really pay attention to this. I know
that I&nbsp;have tons of wise thoughts now. I know that I am
longwinded. I know that people don't have time for this long
discourse stuff. And yet...this is ME. You won't get it this straight
and true from talking to me in person, unless you really try hard.
You will get some cheesy version, some stupid joke version. These are
my attention-getting mechanisms to make people like me (and I freely
admit that). I like being cheesy (I make myself like me too -- self
esteem you might say), but it's a cover for the "steak" inside. Words
here tonight are me being steaky -- tumors and all. So, this is why I
say on my wife page that I really think that "The One" or whatever
almost HAS to have a large appreciation for these steak-pages here.
Otherwise, they won't be showing an initiative to really know me.</P>

<P>Okay, I've spoken my mind, and talked quite honestly and freely.
By doing so I think I've illuminated my mind just a bit and given
myself a little wider perspective of where I am tonight. By the way,
at the moment I am in the pre-honesty sliding stage. Someday, I'll
prove to myself that I can let it go and just watch the snow and ice
melt beneath me and watch the cancer come to a stop. But thus far
that has not been the case in my life. What this particular incident
will bring about, well, I'm not sure, but I'm weak-willed, and I am
on the road to honesty I'm afraid, one way or another. I'll try to
hold out, but I'm not sure how long it'll last. ... Holding out for
dishonesty, isn't that just a cancerously stupid thing to say? But
that is always what happens, because I'm dysfunctional, or something.
River blockage if you keep it in, river blockage if you speak it
out.</P>

<P>So I&nbsp;really should stop writing now. :-) This is long enough
for one wise thought I'm sure. If you feel like you are The Person
mentioned above, in my life or in the life of someone else,
please...tread carefully with your infatuated friend, and realize
that at least to some people these topics are literally some of the
most important of life. And, please don't take offense at my writing
all this down for the world to see. I hope you will agree with what I
said to begin with -- these thoughts are for the most part about ME
and my thoughts and issues. It is only by unfortunate conditions that
my problems gush out in this way and mess up other people's sunny
days. On the other hand, I will take responsibility for my words; I
said them, and if you (anyone) take offense at them, discuss it with
me. Offense is just one more part of the infatuation game, right?</P>

<P>Okay, now I should really really stop writing. If you've read all
of this, good for you. I'd like to leave you with some nice
thought...hmmm....As Job said, in trial or in victory, in hope or in
defeat, in foolishness or wisdom, I can still say, "Blessed be the
name of the LORD". God bless y'all. :-)</P>
