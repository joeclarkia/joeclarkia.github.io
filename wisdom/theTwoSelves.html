<P>It was a warm summer day as two selves walked along the lakeside
path. At a certain point, they agreed to take a break and sit for a
moment on a nearby bench. The selves-container wrapped his arms
around the back of the bench, sprawled out, and contemplated the lake
and the ducks slowly drifting on it. Then, the selves began to
speak.</P>

<P>SelfOne began by saying, "Wow! Isn't this a great view? It is so
great to be out here in the sun enjoying this moment and the simple
pleasures of life."</P>

<P>SelfTwo thought for just a moment and responded, "Yeah, sure, but
wouldn't it be better if you had someone to share this moment
with?"</P>

<P>SelfOne responded, "Well, maybe. Life consists of many moments and
many occasions. On some days one might find that he can focus more on
the beauty of the day in solitude."</P>

<P>SelfTwo shot back, "What? Doesn't that make you lonely? How can
you stand to sit there by yourself when others are sharing moments
just like these and making memories and enjoying time together?"</P>

<P>"Yes, it can be lonely at times,"&nbsp;SelfOne replied, "but that
is not the point. You have to have balance in your life. You can't
always be with others, and you can't always be alone. Life is bigger
than that. You see, SelfTwo, I think you have too small a view of
living. You are thinking only of a piece of life. Expand your
horizons, inflate all your sails, and see where the winds of life
will take you."</P>

<P>SelfTwo complained aloud, "But it's so hard to do that. There are
so many things in life that are boring or painful. You're telling me
those are really part of my life too? Shouldn't I do away with them
whenever possible and hate them the rest of the time? Why should I
endure trial? How can that be considered "living" in any positive
sense?"</P>

<P>SelfOne discoursed: "SelfTwo, my friend, like I said before, your
view of life is too small. You see before you only the briefest
glimpses of your life. Your life today, your thoughts today, are but
one ripple on the waves of time. Look at the lake, full of ripples,
each having an up, each having a down, all interacting on the surface
of the waters. But think of the ducks out there. They live in the
ripples, up and down. They do not despair when they fall into a
valley. Rather, they wait patiently, knowing that the crest will come
soon. And such is life. Life has many occasions, many situations, all
providing a learning experience, all providing a place to grow and a
place to understand a little better, and often the many occasions
overlap and form a quilt of patterns beneath us. Seek out those
ripples. Don't just look for a certain type or a certain corner of
the lake. Embrace all the many kinds of occasions in life, and
realize that you are not really living to the fullest until you are
experiencing the broad range that life has to offer."</P>

<P>SelfOne noticed that SelfTwo was becoming distraught at all this,
and he knew what SelfTwo was thinking, and said, "SelfTwo, I know
you're scared at what I'm saying. I know you want what you think
you've always wanted, and I know you're scared to try for something
else, or to try for balance in life. I know you want to define your
goal and pursue it to the exclusion of all others. You probably don't
see it now, but what I am saying is true...someday you'll understand
this."</P>

<P>SelfTwo struck out and said, "But what about the everyday living?
What about every moment? What about the valleys of the ripples? What
about the days that do not reveal joy, no matter how much effort is
put into living? Surely every moment cannot be lived in this
enlightened perspective."</P>

<P>SelfOne said carefully, "Well, you are right in that regard. There
are days when living is hard, and the joy of diversity and the joy of
life itself is not apparent. Sometimes pain comes when we refuse to
explore the multiplicities of life. Sometimes it comes of its own
accord. But you're right, it does come. But in those times, we must
endeavor to remember that life is bigger than the pain. Life is
bigger than the moment, and bigger than the sources of our
valleys."</P>

<P>SelfTwo, slowly becoming convinced, says, "Okay, but one last
thing. What about when the valleys appear, and I think think think
and search for the silver lining, I search for the multiplicity of
life, and it just isn't there, and living seems solely focused on the
one ripple?"</P>

<P>SelfOne, beginning to wrap up his discourse, replied, "Ahh yes.
You speak of the times when minds lose control, and understandings of
life become confused. At those times, we can try various things, but
one often-overlooked technique is to practice non-thinking."</P>

<P>"Non-thinking? What are you talking about?"</P>

<P>"Well, as you know, our lives are full of thoughts, and we go
through life examining every moment, and we often find ourselves in
the midst of a dream or a nightmare, sometimes even in the same
moment. Both the dream and the nightmare are stressful in their own
way, and they distract us from the balanced life. While it is true
that one of the highest goals of life is self-examination, there are
times when we over-examine our lives and would do well to spend time
living our lives in all their various ways, and to not worry about
examining everything."</P>

<P>SelfTwo nodded slowly, as if convincing himself of the truth of
SelfOne's words even as he nodded....After a few moments of silent
contemplation, they were once again at peace there beside the lake.
Soon the selves-container arose from the bench and continued on down
the path and continued to live and ponder his life with just a bit of
new-found perspective from the conversations between the selves.</P>
