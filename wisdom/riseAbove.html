<P>A man gazes silently as the hot air balloon slowly takes shape. It
seems at first a slow, arduous process, full of loud noises and hot
gases. But suddenly the last long flash of light propels the balloon
upright -- timidly at first, but then with increasing grace and
beauty. The man is reminded of a baby's first steps.</P>

<P>Soon another long flash of hot gas, and the balloon majestically
begins to float, rising slowly at first, then gaining altitude with
each gasp of raw fuel. The balloon soon is soaring high above the
ground, the trees, and all the other surface realities of the
world.</P>

<P>All at once the man finds these words echoing through his soul: "I
want to be there!!" It's as if the balloon were an allegory of his
life. Time after time, the trials have come as great clouds of fire,
and at first the fragile fabric of his life was in danger of being
incinerated. But slowly, slowly, the trials were building a stronger,
more air-worthy man. Even now, the man is reminded of the fires of
life that always seem so near.</P>

<P>But at this time, in this moment, the man bursts out in an
emphatic voice, "I want to be there!! I want to rise on the wings of
the air, flying like the eagle so high, so free. I want to reach for
the heavens, the presence of the Holy One. I want the freedom and the
ecstasy of leaving the pains of earth below. I want to rise above the
plane of earthly perspective and see the bigger picture. I have felt
the trials of fire in my life, and I long for liftoff!!"</P>

<P>As the man watches the balloon float slowly but steadily away, and
as he then turns to go, he is satisfied. He has watched a valuable
allegory unfold before his eyes. He resolves then and there to do his
best to rise above the clamor of his life. He feels the fears
distinctly, the fear that he cannot lift off, and the fear that he
will begin his flight only to crash down to the earth again. But the
promise of rising above and the hope that it brings helps still the
fears and bolster his determination.</P>

<P>Fly, o brave man. Soar on wings of faith, and leave behind the
tethers of the past and the plane of earthly perspective.</P>
