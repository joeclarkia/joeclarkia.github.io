<P>It has become apparent that I am a funny guy -- well, at least in
some sense of the word. The folks at work used to call me "crazy
freaky slow Java Joe", which implies some funniness. But now I think
my unofficial title is "cheesy joke Joe" -- which seems to cement my
place in the funny people hall of fame.</P>

<P>So, with this new title, I suppose I should take a few moments to
reflect upon my new status. So here goes....</P>

<P>First of all, it's a mixed blessing to be thought of as funny.
It's nice to have the attention as the one who does crazy things like
that sideways click-your-heels jump in the hallway at work. It's nice
to at least entertain the idea of not being a boring engineer. But
there is also a responsibility that comes with being funny;
specifically, to know when to shut off the funniness.</P>

<P>Obviously, there are times in life when being funny is not a
correct course of action. I would enumerate, but I probably don't
need to -- you can think of plenty of serious situations that require
thoughtfulness rather than a joke. At these moments, a joke may not
just be out of place, it may be thoroughly destructive, since it is
at these troublesome, serious times when having the right words is
most important.</P>

<P>I am reminded of a passage from that great bard's book
Ecclesiastes:</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><B><I>There is a time for everything, and a
season for every activity under heaven....<BR>
a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to
dance.</I> (Ecc 3:1,4)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Thus there is a time for laughter, a time to be happy and jolly,
even a time for cheesy jokes. But (as I&nbsp;have always been quick
to point out) there is also a time for mourning, weeping, and in
general thinking thoughtful thoughts -- contemplating the meat and
meaning of life, or, the "steak" if you will.</P>

<P>There are many varieties of steak in life. There is one type of
steak that deals with the sadness and bitterness in life. It is found
often after the death of a loved one, the parting of close friends,
the losing of one's job, and other similar events. Then there is a
different type of steak, one that is perhaps the most nourishing of
all. This is the steak of "higher thinking" or of "the beyond" as
I've called it before (the thoughts of the beautification engineer).
Found within this mode of thinking is a sort of laughter and joy all
its own, but it's not the kind of cheese that I've been discussing
thus far. This is a laughter that comes from the heart, not the mind.
It is a laughter that is always tainted with realism. Cheesy laughter
ignores reality and laughs in it's unreality and avoidance. Steak
laughter embraces the realities of life, both good and bad, and finds
joy in the midst of or in spite of the problems.</P>

<P>So in my smorgasbord of life, I want to keep a balance of these
two forces: the humorous "cheese" of life just to keep from being
boring, and the "steak" of life to keep myself grounded in reality
and in the finer things of life. That balance is always a precarious
one, but if we can find it I think we will find life fulfilling for
ourselves, but also we will find it easier to help others be
fulfilled as well.</P>
