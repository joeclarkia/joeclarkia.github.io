<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For a year or more this
phrase has passed through my mind from time to time. It is in many
respects one of the mottoes of my life and how I often think. I'd
like to explain this concept briefly using a few examples.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Take stargazing. This could
be one of the clearest physical examples. Stargazing is a chance to
get away from earthly pursuits for just a bit. For me at least,
stargazing is a quick way to gain some perspective and to enjoy some
of God's creation. I am reminded of the awesome physics and distance
involved in what I am seeing, and at the same time the folklore, the
fact that these same stars have been viewed by humans for generations
and millennia; and I remember the past joys of stargazing with
friends in various situations. Somehow, such a combination of
thoughts produces in me a feeling that can best be explained by
"reaching for the beyond" -- trying to take life as I know it and
infuse it with meaning beyond my normal perspective.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In this Christmas season, we
read about the wise men who saw the star of Christ from their
homeland, and it prompted them to search out the newborn King. This
is a clear picture of my idea of stargazing, I believe. Perhaps our
stargazing cannot always lead directly to the King, but that should
be the goal -- reaching for the beyond is reaching for the Divine
Truth that we so easily lose track of in the midst of the stuff of
life and even the glitz and glamour and normalness of church
life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Another example of
beyond-ness is church services. There are differences in worship
services, with many factors involved. A large factor, to be sure, is
my attitude as a worshipper and my mood that day, but the tone is
also set in part by the worship leaders, and in some sense by every
word that is sung, spoken, or prayed. There are times when the
service (including worship, the sermon, and everything in between)
seems to be a social gathering. Sure the focus is on God, but it
seems as though we are all talking about someone who's not there, and
talking to each other. At other times (and more rarely), it really
does seem that the worshippers are in one accord, and you can imagine
the entire congregation gazing at the sight of God entering and being
present in our midst. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">One other, more earthly
reaching is the reaching for the beyond in interpersonal
relationships. I find this principle valuable, perhaps from a purely
personal standpoint, when I find the group of people I'm with to be
boring or otherwise disagreeable. Reaching beyond in these cases is
trying to infuse meaning into the conversation, something that's
important to me, and looking for conversation that can help one or
both of us to reach for a higher, more noble, more "Divine" even,
state of mind than we came with. A couple of the famous things that
cause me to react this way are 1) sports and 2) talking about beer.
These two topics do not edify me, and do not inspire me to "go
beyond" where I am now, but instead cause me to give a hearty, "why
do I care." Realizing that to some folks these boring subjects are
important does not help much, but it does make me realize that
conversation and relating to other people is a form of art, and the
goal of that art (like any other) is to reach beyond, to form a
stronger friendship, to get to know each other better, to work toward
a common goal, or to make a point clear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">So, I don't know if this
"reaching for the beyond"&nbsp;makes any more sense now, but maybe it
has spurred you on just a bit to think in that regard, and that is
really all I can hope for. It is a tough topic to think about, much
less to explain, but I think it is one that is beneath much of who we
are and how we act, whether we realize it or not. In your days and in
your actions, may your mindset be one of reaching for the beyond,
reaching for something more real, more pure, more refined than the
present. May our lives be filled with striving to reach the goal, not
in a stressful sense, but in a sense of intense enjoyment of the
striving, realizing that we are drawing closer day by day to the God
who created us and to the life that He created us to live.</FONT></P>
