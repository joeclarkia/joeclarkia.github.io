<P>Well, it's that time of year again -- time to think back on 365
days gone by, and to contemplate what the passage of time has taught
me and where it has brought me. Without meaning to hyperbolize here,
I think that 2006 has been the most influential year of my life since
graduating from college. Let me go through the months and recollect
on some of the memorable things, and then provide some general themes
and patterns I see.</P>

<P><B>January.</B> 2006 began with two main things on my mind. My dad
had recently had surgery, and so he was still in the process of
recovery. But the recovery process was going well, and so it was not
a huge thing weighing on my mind. I was also in the midst of what by
my view was my first "real" dating relationship, with Leah from
Wisconsin. I&nbsp;remember at the end of 2005 being pretty excited
about the future possibilities. I spent New Year's Eve last year with
Leah and her family. She visited Cedar Rapids in the middle of the
month, and I visited her at school at the end of the month. That
visit also marked "the beginning" of our breakup. I can state that
fairly matter-of-factly now, but at the time it was quite the
up-and-down month.</P>

<P>In <B>February</B>, Rich visited Cedar Rapids, and I got to meet
his girlfriend (now fiance) Kelly. Also in February, Leah &amp;
I&nbsp;finished up our breakup (thus another up-and-down month). I
convinced myself that I am in fact dysfunctional, or that
relationships in general are dysfunctional, but in the end I think we
both learned things from the experience. I think for me it sort of
set the stage for the rest of the year, and I think God used it to
teach me some things about relationships, about myself, and about how
to better serve him.</P>

<P><B>March</B> was a month of traveling. I participated in Rockwell
Collins' support of the Air Force's Joint Expeditionary Force
Experiment (JEFX) 2006, spending about a week and a half at Nellis
Air Force Base in Las Vegas supporting some software that I have
specialized in for a few years. The experience was a very good one
from my perspective. It blended well with previous "real
world"&nbsp;work experience, namely my work in New Mexico in 2004 and
California in 2005. At JEFX, I&nbsp;gained a better understanding of
how a military operations center works, and honed my understanding of
network management and how it fits into a real-world picture. Both of
these would serve me well in the remainder of my work year.</P>

<P>I also participated in Hillside's mission trip to Guatemala in
March. About fourteen of us spent a week in Guatemala, primarily
building houses in the Lake Atitlan village of San Juan, staying at a
hotel in San Pedro, and helping with a showing of the Jesus Film.
This was my second overseas missions trip (first was to Venezuela in
2000). In 2000, I think I felt a little out of place, and the types
of things we did there didn't quite "fit my style" at the time, or
something. After six years, Guatemala seemed to be a better
experience, and the work was more "manual labor" which seemed easier
for me to get involved with and feel like I was contributing. I still
had the Spanish/English language barrier, which was a big part of why
the manual labor was easier than other more communication-requiring
activities.</P>

<P>Upon returning from Guatemala, I spent one night at home, and then
flew out again, this time to Vancouver, BC in Canada. I went to the
2006 Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS) as a
work-sponsored trip. It was my first conference attendance for work.
It was an interesting experience (note to self: you don't always need
a rental car), but I found overall that it seemed more geared toward
telecom operations than our wireless networking emphasis. Still, I'm
glad I went and had the opportunity to see what the conference life
is all about. And, the views around the area of Vancouver I was in
were pretty cool. And my several hour long walk in Stanley park was
great.</P>

<P>Later in <B>April</B>, I attended VEISHEA&nbsp;at Iowa State.
After being off the calendar for a year due to riots in 2004, it was
good to see VEISHEA&nbsp;at Iowa State back again. From what
I&nbsp;remember, the day was a good one, with no major unruly
incidents.</P>

<P>Also in April, after returning from NOMS, I got serious about
house-hunting. I have never really said this in any public setting
before, but I&nbsp;think there was a causal link between the
relationship stuff of January and February and the seriousness of
moving out on my own. I can't pinpoint exactly what the exact motive
was - something to do with growing up and making decisions, probably
-- but I&nbsp;have to think they were connected, and I&nbsp;have the
idea that if the relationship had not happened (and, more
specifically, had it not failed), I&nbsp;would likely not be living
here in my own house today. I think this is an example of how things
don't always work out the way we intend, but they do work out, and
sometimes God uses things for our benefit that on the surface just
look like a mess.</P>

<P>I signed the initial paperwork on my intent to buy my house on
<B>May</B> 2nd. I had visited perhaps 10-12 other properties with my
realtor <A HREF="http://www.angiegetsyoumovin.com/">Angie
Goetzinger</A> in the previous few weeks. When I viewed this house, I
was interested, but as the whole decision-making thing goes, I wasn't
sure about it. I heard that there was another offer on the house, so
I&nbsp;called my dad up and we walked through the house again.
I&nbsp;made one of those snap decisions (funny how so many things in
life seem to come down to just yes or no on what seems like
incomplete information, incomplete for one because I can't foretell
the future), and made the offer. And here I am today because of it.
Overall, I think it was a wise decision -- good price, good location,
good life change. The whole house purchasing process was interesting
to go through, and I feel like with help from the realtor and advice
from friends and family, the process was mostly painless.</P>

<P>May also brought about Jeremy and Angela's wedding. It was cool to
see their wedding after seeing their relationship develop and grow
over the past several years. Congratulations Jeremy
&amp;&nbsp;Angela. :-)</P>

<P>Finally, near the end of May came MOVING&nbsp;DAY. I&nbsp;had a
serious posse assembled to help me move stuff into my new house. I
thought we would just do big stuff that night, but they pretty much
just came in and took it all dumptruck style. :-) Which turned out to
be very cool. At my house we dropped stuff in the various rooms and
commenced to have a "lawn chair party" cuz I didn't have furniture
yet. Thanks to all who helped make my moving day pretty painless and
a joyous occasion with friends.</P>

<P>By the end of the weekend when I moved, I had acquired most of the
furniture I have now. And in the weeks following, I received a few
other items. As I have given tours since then, I realize that a large
percentage of the furnishings in my house have come from the goodwill
of others, either donated or at a reduced price. I'm not sure I can
name everyone, but thanks so much to the Descalzos for A LOT of
furniture, to my cousin Kyle for the couch, to Myndi for the picture
and the recliner, and to the Tolands for the ping pong table. Thanks
also to Darrell for the several hours he's spent helping me learn the
ropes with a few household projects.</P>

<P>In <B>June</B>, I&nbsp;helped out with the National Trails Day
event at Matsell Bridge Natural Area. It was a little different from
National Trails Day events in CR, but it was cool to revisit the
location (where Rich and I&nbsp;got lost in the dark once and barely
found his car again), and it was cool to see the natural surroundings
in rural Linn County.</P>

<P>Later in June, I rode in the (Suzanne)Blackfordmobile to Phil's
wedding in Indianapolis. Spending a weekend in a car with Suzanne and
Matt is rather exciting. :-) And the wedding itself was quite
memorable. Phil and Natalie had an outdoor wedding in a park, and it
was PERFECT&nbsp;weather for it. The right temperature, sunny skies
with just a few clouds. Natalie-the-bride was escorted in on a horse
and buggy, and they both were escorted out on it. There were a number
of Hillsiders there to celebrate Phil's big day, and at the reception
it seemed a little like Pastor Kory's alumni reunion -- with so many
of his former youth group students there, now several years later.
Also after the reception, several of us from Hillside sat in a lounge
at the hotel and talked about... whatever.. and that was a cool
"community" feeling.</P>

<P>In early <B>July</B>, I&nbsp;visited Maya and Tony in Minneapolis.
Rich and Kelly and Rich's brother and a couple others stayed
overnight one night in the M&amp;T&nbsp;hotel. We all went to a
Minnesota Twins baseball game as well. Rich &amp;&nbsp;Company were
on their way to Mount Rushmore, so they left the next morning to
continue their trip. The rest of the weekend I did the usual Maya and
Tony thing, I think (you know, go to the electronics store, etc).</P>

<P>Later in July was my annual happiness at Family Camp. As usual, it
was a great time. Phil and I&nbsp;were the sound booth crew again.
Angela helped Lindy in the nursery. Jen led children's activities,
with help from Paula from Independence. And.. no one threw up in my
cabin this year (oh the 2005 memories).</P>

<P><B>August</B> was another busy month. I held my first major party
at my house on August 5th. Three of us Watershedders have birthdays
in August (Fawn, Amy, and me), so we had a combined birthday party at
my house. I&nbsp;don't think we had a final tally, but there were
probably 30 people that showed up for at least part of the time. Good
times.</P>

<P>The next weekend, I went with several Watershedders to the Iowa
State Fair in Des Moines. This was my first time at the state fair,
so that made it extra special. We got there just in time to hear
Sheltered Reality, a cool drum bad with a cool message for young
people. After that, we did ... stuff... and ... more stuff. We tried
to go as a group, but it was hard to organize everyone, so basically
we were in multiple groups most of the time. At the end of the day,
we crashed at one of the exhibits for 45 minutes or so, and then some
of the group went out to eat at a restaurant, and the rest of us hung
out at Kathryn's for a while before heading home.</P>

<P>August was the sendoff for three different Hillside alumni
couples: Stephen and Laura Descalzo -- to language training in the
Carolinas, Dan &amp;&nbsp;Becky Todd -- to a church in Nebraska, and
Pastor Mike &amp; Ashley -- to a youth pastor position in
Bartlesville). Dan &amp;&nbsp;Becky were already on their way, but
the PIGS&nbsp;hosted a party after church for the Descalzos and Mike
&amp; Ashley, giving them a warm Hillside sendoff to their new areas
of ministry. Bittersweet.</P>

<P>Toward the end of August, I spent a weekend helping Ida (from
Minnesota) clean up her house in prepration for her moving out of the
house and into the nearby town of Winona. The experience reminded me
of a mission trip, since there was a clear focus on work that needed
to be done, but enough spare time to enjoy the weekend too. I fell in
love with shop vacs that weekend, as I found them very useful for
sucking up dead bugs, caked on dirt from the last 30 years, little
bits of brick, etc etc.</P>

<P><B>October</B> held a couple family events: My cousin (2nd
cousin?) on my dad's side, Brianne, got married. It was a nice
service, with some cool musicians to go with, and the reception was
nice. One of my other cousins -- this one on my mom's side -- Kelli,
visited Iowa from her home in California, letting us all get first
looks at her new adopted baby, Ivy. We oohed and aahed while we ate
at Granite City.</P>

<P>October was also the time of the Haunted Trail. This was the
second year for the event. With ideas from last year, the planning
wasn't quite as hectic, but getting volunteers was a busy process, as
it was last year. On the day of the event, the weather was fairly
cold, and the turnout wasn't terrific, but we all had fun anyway, and
it was cool to participate in this event on the trail and to work
with other volunteers in planning it (primarily Sandy).</P>

<P>Sometime this fall, I&nbsp;signed up for the CRANDIC&nbsp;Yahoo
Group. There are a few people who post messages on this group about
CRANDIC, one of the local train companies that I've been interested
in since childhood. In November, word came out about several train
engine roster changes... The CRANDIC&nbsp;stopped running "road"
trains (to Iowa City or Amana) recently, and so they have sold their
four road engines. Taking their place, they are purchasing a number
of new(used) switch engines, mostly MP15s. It has been cool to watch
these changes take place, and see some of the behind-the-scenes
details made available via the Yahoo group. I'm not the only one who
gets excited about CRANDIC! :-)</P>

<P><B>November</B> was also another outing of the CIA. CIA, or
"Christ In Action" is a Hillside small group that was formed early in
2006. CIA focuses on doing service projects in the local community,
projects that aim to "share the love of Jesus in a practical way." We
did several such projects in 2006. On the day after Thanksgiving,
several of us got up at about 4am to prepare hot chocolate and serve
it to people waiting for the stores to open. We distributed about 10
gallons of hot chocolate that morning, and added a little warmth to
the days of a lot of people. CIA&nbsp;is a cool group, and I hope we
continue to do more projects like these, and invite others in the
church to participate with us in these activities.</P>

<P><B>December</B> has been a month of... hospitality, I guess I'll
say. I hosted my first Christmas Open House this month. I printed out
a flyer and invited pretty much everyone I could think of -- church,
work, Watershed, neighbors, etc. This event gave me a chance (excuse)
to finally go meet most of my neighbors (besides the one that I'd
talked to in the last six months). In the end, only one of the 7 or 8
neighbors showed up, but I was glad to see the one at least. All in
all, about 35 people showed up to my open house, so I called the
night a success. The Hillside-people-my-age New Year's Eve party is
going to be at my house too.</P>

<P>So those have been the highlighted activities of the year. Now I
want to focus a little bit on the "themes"&nbsp;I've seen developing,
and comment a little on them, and where I think God has been leading
me.</P>

<P><B>The Kingdom of God. </B>Sometime late in 2005, I&nbsp;attended
Solomon's Porch, the church that Maya and Tony now go to. I didn't
know much about it at the time, but it turns out it's one of the
"emerging" churches. Some time later, I became more and more
impressed with some of the ideas of the emerging church movement. For
one, I have seen what seems to be a renewal of faith in Maya as she
has found a group of people that seem to see things more her way. And
beyond that, the emerging church ideas make sense to me as well.
Basically (in my view) they start with the idea that the Kingdom of
God is now, that it is our duty to work for the Kingdom while we're
on this earth. We aren't just in some holding pattern waiting for the
Rapture. This resonates with me because I think I like to be busy
DOING something, instead of just talking about it.</P>

<P>In the midst of my studying of the emerging church movement, I
started to realize that Hillside has a lot of the traits of an
emerging church. That is just my opinion, and there are some things
about the movement that we at Hillside may not really adhere to, but
it's a similar spirit -- a spirit of service, a spirit of building
the Kingdom, of working to build our community, of doing away with
the imaginary rift between "sacred" and "secular." That's how I see
it at least, and with that sight, I have gained a newfound respect
and joy for being at Hillside and hearing these conversations. Thanks
especially to Pastor Kory and to Cathy W for insight on these matters
and where we want our church to be going in the future as we seek to
serve Jesus.</P>

<P><B>The Disciplined Life.</B> This fall, Pastor Kory taught a
Sunday evening class on spiritual disciplines, based on Richard
Foster's book "Celebration of Discipline." We talked about a host of
spiritual disciplines, from the usual ones like prayer and Scripture
reading, to the lesser talked about ones of meditation, submission,
and fasting. I was challenged to make many more of these disciplines
a part of my life. However, in the few months since the end of the
class, I have seen YET&nbsp;AGAIN how hard old habits are to break,
and how hard it is to seriously change my lifestyle. I have not been
good at keeping up this disciplined life. When planning for 2007, I
need to do some reflection on this topic and decide how best to apply
my efforts -- how I can work toward a true life change, and not just
something I do for a few weeks while part of a group.</P>

<P><B>Service.</B> As I mentioned earlier, my involvement in local
service has grown a lot this year. I have been (at least in
theory)&nbsp;coordinating local service projects for Hillside for
over a year now. I&nbsp;think even after that amount of time, I'm
still trying to find ways to better organize that oversight and get a
better handle on how and what I&nbsp;should be doing. But with the
development of CIA, I feel better about the work that Hillside is
doing in the community. CIA gives us as group members, and by
extension the church as a whole, a "focus group" to help keep service
on the forefront of our minds as we seek to serve Jesus as we live
out our lives.</P>

<P>In addition to Hillside, this fall I took over partial
responsibility for the local service portion of Watershed (along with
Chad). As we work more toward this end in 2007, hopefully we will
find beneficial ways that we can be a blessing to others in the
community.</P>

<P><B>Work.</B> I have noticed a couple of trends at work. First of
all, with my experiences at JEFX and later work related to that, and
participation in AFCEA, the Armed Forces Communications and
Electronics Association, I feel that my "field of view" is expanding.
Maybe that means I'm growing up to be a systems engineer after all.
But instead of just writing bits of software code to do a specific
function, I am beginning to ask more questions like "Is this really
the best way to solve the problem? Do we even understand the real
problem?" etc. This changes the work I do, but also leads to some
very stimulating discussions as we seek to understand the customer
better so that we can provide a more optimal solution.</P>

<P>On the other hand, perhaps as a byproduct of getting more involved
with the higher-level discussions, I have also been more aware of the
politics involved in the whole corporate bureaucracy. As an impatient
engineer, sometimes I think the the corporate bureaucracy is just
overkill, and what we call professionalism is sometimes more aptly
termed "gridlock." Part of this problem is the fact that I've seen on
almost a daily basis that person-to-person and
organization-to-organization communication is a huge problem
everywhere I go, especially at work. Specific examples could be
mentioned, but the point is that I&nbsp;have been stretched this year
to work in conditions that are not as simple as they once seemed to
be. In 2007 I hope to get a better understanding of what my role
should be in addressing these problems, and seeking to promote better
communication at work, and more efficiency and less politics when
possible.</P>

<P><B>Decisions.</B> The early part of this year especially was an
exercise in decision making skills. This might be a big part of why I
wonder sometimes whether I am bona fide dysfunctional. During the
"relationship phase" of this year (and the tail end of 2005), I was
faced with relationship decisions: "Do I like this person" "Should I
date this person" "Do I see a future here" "Are we compatible" "Can I
handle a long distance relationship" -- questions like that. I found
that those kinds of questions can eat me up if I&nbsp;let them. In
other words, I have a predisposition to overanalyze things to some
unhealthy level. When the questions finally got to be too much, and
the relationship didn't work, I learned that lesson the hard way. I
was still thinking about these decision-making skills when I started
looking for a house. "If I can't decide what I think about a
relationship, how can I decide where I want to live and where I want
to stake my future?"&nbsp;Worse yet, I&nbsp;was ambivalent still
about leaving home in the first place. But, when the time came, I
staked my claim and made my choice. Even when I signed those first
papers, it was a bit of a step of faith, praying and hoping that this
house was a good choice. But really, I guess faith would be a key
word. I can't tell the future. I can make an educated decision, but
maybe this year taught me that there is no such thing as a 100% sure
decision. And sometimes big decisions even seem fairly arbitrary, but
you have to just take the step and make a decision. Don't be hasty,
but don't hold back forever. Take a risk. Your future self may thank
you for taking that risk.</P>

<P><B>Love Life.</B> If there is one bittersweetness in my
reflection, I suppose it would be in my so-called love life. It
started off promising, but that wasn't meant to be. But I'm really
not just thinking of that. Throughout the year, I've been thinking
about the related topics. They have not ruled my life, but they've
been there (just like they always are). This is an area where God is
obviously still working on me. I&nbsp;am left with two opposing
viewpoints: "Let go, and just serve God, and let God worry about the
prospect of love and getting married someday" vs. "You have to be a
man; you have to lead; if you want to get married, then act like it
and take steps toward it (like asking people out)." Who to believe?
Or another set of conflicting statements, "It's not good for man to
be alone" vs. "Some people are just meant to be single."</P>

<P>I am glad for my relationship experiences this year, helping me to
see that I am not completely inept, and just generally giving me some
perspective. But they have also again left me jaded, wondering if
this whole love thing isn't just some game that we play, and that we
love people when we choose to live in mutual infatuation. Yeah yeah,
I still have some messed up inclinations of course, mostly because I
haven't perfected the art of loving people correctly yet. I don't
know what 2007 may hold in this regard, and it's probably best not to
guess, but I hope that God will continue to lead me on this
particular journey, and I pray that he would work to turn my
dysfunction into something that looks more like the youthful idealism
that still exists somewhere in my mind. And in the meantime, the
other good things God has given me this year -- good friends, good
church, good coworkers, good house, etc. -- will keep me busy.</P>

<P>So, at the end of my review, what can I say? Time and again
throughout this year, especially recently, I've been amazed at how
blessed I am. As I just said, I have been blessed by God with a
number of good things, and have been kept in good health and,
arguably, good spirits. There's definitely more work to be done in my
life as I seek to become more like Jesus, but I am glad for the steps
I've seen in my growth in 2006. In some ways I almost feel guilty for
the blessings I've been given, as I see others around me who have (it
would seem) many fewer blessings. But I celebrate the goodness of God
in this transition of the years, and I hope to be able to share and
spread that celebration in this coming year. I&nbsp;hope to seek God
in the community and in solitude, to continue to pursue "right
doctrine" and "right practice" as the emerging folks say.</P>

<P>May you be aware of the blessings of God as you go through each
day. Amen.</P>
