Bye</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The song with that title has caught
my ear a few times, and from what I hear, it's pretty popular right
now. I'm not really referring to the song here, but you can draw a
parallel if it seems appropriate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This has been one of those
bittersweet weeks. Some things have went well, some things just okay,
and some things have been rather tragic for many. For me personally,
I&nbsp;have completed a few homework assignments, looked for a summer
job, and heard a good report just this afternoon about an exam score.
(Yeah! Praise God!)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But it is a growing observation of
mine, not really related to any one person or any specific incident,
that people put forth little effort to get to know me. There are
exceptions <I>(there are always exceptions)</I>, but for the most
part, I go about my life hearing goodbyes, and even trying to
pre-empt them, so I don't seem to be weighing down on their lives and
being a burden and wasting their precious time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I first noticed this on Instant
Messenger, and I still notice it there the most. I&nbsp;have a
tendency (call me strange), to enjoy talking to people when I see
them log on. But (especially for those on AOL, not just on AIM), I
feel like my random "hi"s are probably just annoying to them. I've
tried hard to reciprocate this idea in my mind, to see if I react the
same way. But (especially recently) I've realized that I&nbsp;like it
when people IM&nbsp;me, even if they're interrupting something else
I'm doing. On the other hand, since people IM&nbsp;me -- well, almost
never -- I'm not in the same situation as someone who gets 10 or 20
IMs every time they log on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because of the premonition that
everyone is wanting to get rid of me, I try to refrain from talking
to people too much, and when I do initiate a conversation, I usually
try not to talk to people for too long, and I've worked hard at
tearing myself away, rather than making them say they have better
things to do. Really, I don't often have all that much new to say to
people anyway...it's just the talking that seems important. Still,
I&nbsp;get tired of people telling me they have to go after talking
for maybe three minutes. It's to be expected, and surely they do have
better things to do than to talk with me about nothing, but it's
still a sinking feeling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The idea of initiation causes me to
cringe. Traditionally, guys are supposed to initiate in a lot of
areas. Well, fine. I don't really like initiation, but I could get
used to it. But what good does initiation do if it's always just
being a pain to the receiver, and often ends in rejection of some
sort? Would not my better half tell me to not initiate if it only
causes problems? At times, I'd like to initiate a lot more than I do,
just to test people and see if they would ever catch on that
I&nbsp;enjoy talking with them -- but that's a bad attitude to have,
I think, to test people like that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Lately, I've observed these sorts of
things happen a lot in "real life" as well as in the pseudo-world of
IM. It seems as though people tend to run away from conversation.
When was the last time I sat down and had a long-ish conversation
with anyone (again, with a few exceptions)? I sense a trend of
"entropy" with the people around me. I'd like to talk to people, but
I don't really have much to say, and even when I do, I say it and
it's over...so much for conversation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I have done my best to specifically
*not care* about this sort of stuff, and I think I am learning to be
more objective about it than I used to be, or just more used to it.
But with every goodbye, with every disappointment, people seem one
step further away. I will press on; I will "make it." But I can't
help thinking it would be a whole lot more fun if people were a bit
more talkative once in a while.

Here's the vocabulary word for the day: <I>kvetch</I>. It's Yiddish
for "complainer." If you think I'm <I>kvetch</I>ing, well, I suppose
I am. If you'd like to <I>kvetch</I> at me and return the favor, you
can write me at </FONT><A HREF="mailto:joeclark@iastate.edu"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">joeclark@iastate.edu</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Have a nice day, one and all. "Bye."
