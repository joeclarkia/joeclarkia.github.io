<P>Dec 31, 2000</P>

<P>Dear Joe,</P>

<P>Congratulations! You've made it -- almost. One semester left, and
your college years will be behind you.</P>

<P>Do you remember when you started on your journey in the land of
Ames? You were excited and a bit nervous all at once. You were more
prepared than some -- you were blessed with a great roommate, had
your major firmly decided, and had a good scholarship. But still you
were concerned about leaving family and friends behind in Cedar
Rapids.</P>

<P>Look where God has brought you, though! From the beginning, things
were looking bright. Sure, the first semester was tough, with Physics
1 and Calc 2, but with God's help you made it (with good grades
even). You began to "bond" with some of your hallmates. You began to
plug yourself into an encouraging and uplifting church. You became
involved with two great campus groups.</P>

<P>From there things have been up and down, but mostly up. You have
learned along the way about what it means to be a good friend (and
when to let go); you have learned about love (and what love isn't);
you have learned about how God provides when you don't understand how
He will. You have made some great friendships. You have increased
your knowledge of computer engineering, readying yourself for a
career. And you have had time along the way to ponder this life and
what it all means.</P>

<P>And now, you are approaching the beginning of a new year, and more
importantly the beginning of your last semester at Iowa State. I know
you always try to fill your days with meaning, to make the most of
every opportunity, to save the best for last, etc. But just to
refresh your memory, I'd like to give you a few exhortations.</P>

<P>1) As always, get a head start on everything worth doing. From
past experience, you know full well that deadlines, especially class
deadlines, can sneak up quickly. Of course you don't procrastinate on
purpose, but in mid-semester, there are so many daily
responsibilities that it becomes hard to devote time to long-range
projects. So stay on task.</P>

<P>2) Keep your daily schedule in check so that you can make time
for...other priorities. Never be too busy to take a few minutes to
"enjoy life" -- to watch the sunset, the sunrise, the stars, the
trees in the spring, to take a bike ride around the great city of
Ames, or to have a conversation with a friend (or a stranger).
Remember that life is about more than classwork. Remember that
classes, while they are important, are passing, and it's the people
you'll remember the most.</P>

<P>3) Make an effort to get up earlier. Sure, there will be those
2:30 a.m. nights, but strive to go to bed at a decent hour (midnight
or before), and to get up before 6:30. Try to catch a few glimpses of
the sunrise, especially when it doesn't conflict with breakfast.
Also, attempt to establish a more dedicated schedule of Bible
reading, instead of the rather haphazard schedule during fall
2000.</P>

<P>4) Build bridges. This is a far-reaching goal, I suppose, but you
know what I mean. Keep in touch with Iowa State friends via telephone
and in person. Do things with people. Be careful not to be a burden,
but take advantage of every opportunity to build relationships. Try
to restore better relationships with high school friends via email or
telephone. You know that the tendency is to let the email-based long
distance friendships slip away. You've seen that happen over the
course of three years. But strive to improve the situation. After
all, you know that these high school friends may well be your main
peer group in the months and years to come if you find yourself in
Cedar Rapids after graduation.</P>

<P>5) Be wise with financial issues. This is a double-edged sword. Of
course you realize you must be careful how you spend your money. I
know this will be an increasing problem, with thoughts of salary
budgeting in mind, and purchasing a car and getting established in a
career. On the other hand, though, don't be too stingy. You've
learned in college not to worry so much about eating at "non-fast
food" restaurants. Sure "real" restaurants are more expensive, but if
you spend within reason, it'll work out. Life is not about the food,
but about the people you eat it with. Consider the cost, small or
great, as a token offering for the opportunity to eat with others.
Also, do not be stingy with your offerings to God and to the church.
You know God has blessed you throughout your college years, so be
willing to support a God-ordained cause that you feel led to support.
Finally, be mindful of the needs around you, whether they be
spiritual, physical, or other. If you can help, and feel God's call,
by all means do it. Be willing to change your plans, even at the last
minute, if you really think it's something you should do. Don't be
lazy.</P>

<P>6) Don't be a coward. I won't chastise you, but consider whether
you've lived up to your potential or not. Have you shied away from
risks in the past for fear of failure? Consider wisely the decisions
that come before you. Don't refuse to take risks just because they
are new or because you might fail. If you do take a risk, and do
fail, don't let that keep you from dusting off your garments and
continuing your walk.</P>

<P>7) Let your motto be "Enjoy life." This is not an irresponsible
enjoyment, but a deep-seated joy and energy that can transcend
whatever difficulty may come. You know that your life has been
"cush," and you've had only a few real tests of faith. But practice
your faith and trust as best you know how, facing each test, large or
small, with the grace of a wise man, not the quick-tempered whining
of a fool. Keep in the back of your mind the remembrance that life
should be joyful, even if it's not always happy. Seek out joy even in
the midst of trial or melancholy. Seek to give out joy, and continue
to purify and selfless-ize your joy-giving. Seek out the love of God
and of others, but work just as hard if not harder at perfecting your
love for God and others -- a love beyond mere words, and a love
beyond the sappy sentimentality or (on the other hand) the empty
facade that is often seen. Don't lose your reflective flair. Don't
get so caught up in "stuff" that you can't see the stuffless things
of life. Sometimes the stuff clings to the worthwhile things in life
(tarnished silver), and sometimes the stuff is simply excess baggage
to be dealt with quickly or to be thrown overboard entirely. Be wise
when to remove the tarnish, and when to take out the trash. Remember
the fountain by the golf course. Remember Reiman Gardens. Remember
the swingset at the old Hawthorn Court. Remember central campus stars
at night. Remember the Festival of Lights on the ISU sidewalks.
Remember study trips to Friley late at night. Remember Brookside
Park. Remember the starfade. Remember sunrises. Remember the sunsets
in Buchanan. Remember the (very) occasional hot air balloons.
Remember the football games. Remember the trail between Hy-Vee and
Vet Med. Remember all the out-of-the-way places that make Ames
unique.</P>

<P>Joe, I hope you will heed my words, and be intentional about
making this semester the best one yet. I have focused on your
personal life -- your thought life -- in this letter, but I hope you
will extend that to others as well. Remember your service is to
others and not only yourself. Continue to grow in the disciplemaking
mentality. Remember to do everything as if working for God, and
remember to seek God's help in all you do. Treat Jesus as your divine
friend, and I believe He will draw near to you. I know you've felt
that Jesus was distant sometimes, but hang in there...continue to
hold up your end, always be accepting of correction from those you
trust (listen to it with respect, even if you don't agree), and wait
on Jesus' timing.</P>

<P>May the Lord's grace be with you, my friend.</P>

<P>Your self,<BR>
- Joe</P>
