<P>I started reading this book early in 2005, but plan to spend more
time reading it now, at the end of 2005. I plan to record some key
quotes here, to make it easier to see the key points of the
book...</P>

         <P>Imagine going backwards through time - the whole universe
         shrinking back, reversing the "big bang," contracting in a
         big suck into a tiny singularity, a shrinking point of
         unimaginable density and unimaginable potential. And imagine
         that point blinking out to...nothing. Don't imagine just
         empty space. That's not nothing enough. Imagine empty space,
         and then imagine the matrix of space itself contracting into
         nothing and time as we know it folding in on itself until it
         too disappears.</P>

         <P>I&nbsp;don't think we can imagine nothing... as soon as
         we try to think about nothing, nothing becomes a something
         that we think about existing somewhere at some time, and at
         that moment we've stopped thinking about nothing.</P>

         <P>We can only imagine a God in whom love can exist and be
         shared without being selfish love.</P>

         <P>Language is the best tool we have, but it keeps getting
         in the way. So in science, we revert to mathematics. And in
         theology, we revert to poetry.</P>

         <P>God creates the matrix of space and time so that beings
         can be, so that the beings imagined by the Being can be
         expressed in an <I>outside</I>, in a <I>somewhere</I>...in a
         place and time.</P>

         <P>It's something shocking, maybe put best when it's put in
         a way that borders on heresy: God is not enough, the story
         says. That has nothing to do with any deficiency in God; it
         has to do with the storyline God had in mind for us. God
         doesn't want to be the only reality in our lives, the only
         relationship in our network, the only message on our
         screen...Noticing and naming and enjoying our fellow
         creatures, as we're doing today, is part of why we're
         here.</P>

         <P>&#91;the ancient Middle Eastern story&#93; agrees with
         the Eastern belief that the universe pulsates with meaning,
         as one would expect of any universe that was spoken by Being
         into being. It celebrates a different kind of enlightenment
         - not scientific, but mystical - that comes from seeing the
         universe as an expression of the mind and heart of God, in
         which God's breath breathes, and God's language sings, and
         God's fingerprints are detected and felt, and God's
         signature is read.</P>
