<P><B><I>How much effort should be spent in discussions with seekers
(or nonseekers) who ask questions that seem irrelevant to their
immediate need of salvation?</I></B></P>

<P>To the practicing Christian:</P>

<P>Recently, I've had a few thoughts pertaining to apologetics and
the limits to which we should spend our moments of conversation on
apologetics topics. What I mean is this: Suppose a person comes to
you and asks, "If God is just, as you say He is, how can He send
people to hell who never heard about Jesus? -- What about the Native
Americans before Christianity came to America?" Questions such as
this one are typical of those faced by apologists. But (disturbingly
to me), I often find Christians getting tired of the debates, and
saying, "Well, it isn't an issue for you personally right now. If you
can ask the question, it doesn't apply to you. What is important
right now is for you to evaluate what you know of Jesus and the
Gospel and make your decision based on that."</P>

<P>I see a problem here. This Christian response is, of course, true.
But it neglects an important issue: I believe (strange as it may
seem) that most people who ask these questions really are looking for
an answer, and not just trying to play mind games. But instead of
making easy-out responses like the one above, I think their questions
deserve a thoughtful answer, based on our best interpretation and
discernment of the Scriptures. What I believe they are saying is this
(for the question above, as an example):&nbsp;"The Gospel you're
showing me says that God is just, and loving, and wants everyone to
be saved. I'm trying to relate that to my life, but I have a hard
time believing it because of this intellectual issue....can you help
me out?"</P>

<P>Now, that more basic question definitely deserves an answer, I
believe. They are not just playing with hypothetical or irrelevant
issues; they are dealing with the attributes of God. In order to
believe what we're telling them, it's important to have their
observations and experiences fit into this new teaching that they're
hearing. In a sense we are attempting to vindicate God, to intercept
the issues raised by the Gospel or the Bible in general, and deal
with them in a sensible manner so that God's attributes are still
believable and reliable. And yes, in some cases there are no good
answers, and the Gospel must simply be accepted on faith; in some
cases it may not be our place to try and vindicate God -- maybe
that's the Holy Spirit's job (I am opening myself to correction
here.) But it seems to me that avoiding the seemingly irrelevant
issues and questions may actually be counterproductive in winning the
intellectually-inclined masses for Christ.</P>
