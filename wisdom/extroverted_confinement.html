<P>I'm so weird. I wonder...it used to often be the case that
I&nbsp;thought I understood myself, and I was trying to figure out
other people, and God, and the world. But at least for this topic,
it's really more about not understanding myself. Maybe that's a good
thing, if it's true that my never-ending searches are turning inward
instead of always finding fault with people around me. (But I dunno,
there's still a good share of interpersonal issue here...).</P>

<P>Anyway, I've noticed lately (and previously too, see my "Tier
2"&nbsp;wise thought from two years ago) that I am all right at
meeting people, but I don't usually develop a strong bond with
people. So I&nbsp;can bring people into the groups I have met people
in, and those new people will quickly surpass me in my "friendedness"
in such groups. What is that anyway? Officially I'm not supposed to
care (who am I to judge or compare?), so officially I don't (freedom
from desire still has its work to do in me sometimes). But
unofficially it is annoying when I work ("work") at making friends,
and then for other people it seems so easy, even with the exact same
friend-people. I make happy okay "can you fix my computer" friends,
they make what appear to be really great sappy "you are so special"
friends (maybe I&nbsp;read too much into things). Whatever, I don't
get it, it bothers me, and I'm a whiner because of it right?</P>

<P>Now, I'm going to point the finger at myself for a while. This is
why I&nbsp;put "work" in quotes in the previous paragraph. Maybe the
reason I don't reach Tier 2 is that I don't try hard enough. Sure I
am busier than some and so don't always have as much time to do
social stuff and all, but that's not always the whole reason.
Sometimes I realize that the extroversion of many is just a trap for
me. I&nbsp;mean, I can feel extroverted, and act extroverted, and act
all silly and junk, but if I were to grow up and be "mature" I think
I would revert to a state of appx. 70% introversion. And I'm not so
sure that people know how to react to that. They may say "that's
fine" but really they mean, "too bad, loser who doesn't want to hang
out with us" or they mean, "fine, have it your way, bye" -- I guess
maybe that's the same attitude.</P>

<P>What really makes me mad is that I want it both ways. I want to
have friends, and I want to *feel*&nbsp;like they're my friends, and
not just people around me. I want to be extroverted if that's what it
takes to feel like my friends are my friends and not just people
waiting to pass me up for someone else. But I also *don't* want to be
an extrovert if it's not natural for me. I don't want to exert a
bunch of energy on something that's not my style (legitimately, not
just if I'm lazy). I don't want to always have to be whining about
spending extra time driving across town to be social. And, if I am an
introvert, I really value my "solitude" (eg, I wanna waste my time in
whatever way I see fit). Sometimes I like social stuff. Sometimes I
like doing stuff with people. Sometimes I can't wait for a meeting or
an event to happen. But I finally have to admit that I like leaving
big groups, I like dropping people off at home so I can play what I
want to on the radio, I like a night by myself, I&nbsp;like sitting
here thinking, or sitting here wasting time, or whatever. So I'm not
always a people person. Oops.</P>

<P>But if I carry that to the logical conclusion, I shouldn't care
too much what people do while I'm off being solitudinous right? But
obviously I do care. Again, I wanna have it both ways. I want to
spend time with people, at least I do on my terms. I don't even know
what my terms are for sure, but I&nbsp;think my terms are more
"purpose-driven", more goal-oriented, more &lt;bad
explanation&gt;&nbsp;"outdoorsy" than what other people are
interested in. There are certain things I like to do, with or without
other people, and certain things I&nbsp;really don't wanna do, with
or without people. Maybe a problem is that the bigger the group, the
more opinions there are on what to do, and so the less frequently I
get to have real input on what happens. The only example I can think
of along those lines is movies. So there are some movies I&nbsp;like,
and some I don't. But if I&nbsp;go with a group, will they watch a
movie I&nbsp;like? Maybe, or maybe not. I have my voice, but it's
easy to get overruled. So I&nbsp;can watch a boring movie, or I can
go be solitudinous again. Usually I suppose I'll watch the boring
movie, but really I&nbsp;might find my time more enjoyable to just do
something by myself. Weirdo introvert. But then, reverse it again: If
I&nbsp;were to go do something by myself, I would still be mad that I
wasn't sharing in the movie with the other people (the people
watching the movie would surely be beating me to Tier 2 -- right?).
Some people just cannot be pleased sometimes.</P>

<P>This topic has a lot to do with my "hanging out"&nbsp;wise thought
previously. I've done a lot of hanging out this fall. I've met new
people. It's been cool. It's been fun. For the most part. I guess.
Kinda. And yet I'm still here complaining about it. How stupid is
that? On the surface, the reason I'm complaining is that I've felt
like I've been pulled (by half of me)&nbsp;to do things that I really
don't wanna do. Like what? Like staying out crazy late just "hanging
out." This is a very specific definition. Staying late at restaurants
doesn't count. Staying late for good discussion doesn't count.
Staying late for movies doesn't count. Staying late for stargazing
doesn't count. So what in the world does count? "Pure" hanging out,
if that makes any sense. If I'm sitting on someone's floor, not
really contributing to anything, maybe paying more attention to the
dog than to anything else around me, and it's 2am, and I have to work
at 8am, and the conversation is on some boring topic I don't care
about -- that is the annoying time of hanging out. That's when
I&nbsp;should call it a night and go home. And eventually I do, but
not always as early as maybe I should.</P>

<P>Anyway, this wise thought is supposed to be about my thoughts, not
about situations. What is it that makes me annoyed when someone calls
me and interrupts my four hours of time to myself? According to my
whining wise thoughts, I should be glad for the call. It depends on
who's calling, but still, anymore the number of people who produce
happiness rather than just "okay"ness or "let the voice mail answer
it"ness is decreasing I think. What it makes me think is that I'm
getting more selfish. Stupid me. I choose to tie this in with the
theory that if I&nbsp;lose my youthful idealism I will retreat into
my introverted shell and be boring and of little use to myself or God
or anyone else. I cling to this thing called "youthful idealism"
(which in a better phrasing is probably the same as "hope") not quite
sure what it is, but seeing that it is at the moment very important
to me. Maybe I'll change one day, but how can I be anything but
"freaked out"&nbsp;if my thoughts ever turn away from what seems to
give the most legitimate "hope"?</P>

<P>If my thoughts do lead me away from "youthful idealism," then that
brings up another issue. What if by some chance my personality leads
me farther away from enjoying large groups? What if I get more and
not less introverted? Not to the point of dysfunction, I assume, but
more than I am now. Well, the kinds of thoughts that say, "Leave me
alone and let me play with my fluorescent light bulbs in peace" is,
when you cut out all the garbage, a lot&nbsp;less eternally
beneficial than to say, "Sure, I'll go eat at IHOP&nbsp;with you and
15 other people and talk about life or something." If I retreat into
myself and my little pet projects (of which there are many), I will
bore myself, let alone everyone else. I will be doing what
I&nbsp;think I want, but it won't bring the satisfaction that being
with other people will. Because in spite of my introvertedness and
junk, I still say that community building is my passion, or at least
the closest thing for me that has any lasting value at all. So here
I&nbsp;have this thing I&nbsp;like to think is my passion, but my
attitudes don't always support it.</P>

<P>There are alternative possibilities in this topic too. Maybe the
amount of sleep I get plays a bigger role than I realize. Maybe if I
got more than 5-6 hrs on average I would be more settled. Maybe if I
really didn't waste so much time doing stupid stuff (stupid = stuff I
don't need to do, doesn't really benefit much, and in the end doesn't
even hold my attention or captivate my creativity very much) -- maybe
then I'd have more time to think about useful stuff.</P>

<P>Another thought is that maybe I don't really hang out with my
peers. Or put more nicely, maybe the people I hang out with don't
talk peerly with me. What I mean is that maybe, like I always say,
I'm searching for the beyond and they're searching for the next
shootemup movie or the next fun time of random hanging out. This
possibility is made more probable by the observation that
I&nbsp;really like IM&nbsp;conversations, because I can at least say
what I&nbsp;wanna say (whether the other party responds or not is a
different matter). So, "going beyond" takes effort and focus, and who
has that? Who is even searching for that? Maybe just maybe I surround
myself with those who aren't searching for that, at least not on the
surface, which is where this random hanging out happens. I&nbsp;know,
I'm being harsh, and I don't really mean to be. If I seem to be
calling people "shallow" what I&nbsp;mean is that the situations are
shallow situations; I have this strong suspicion that most people
have a non-shallow side, whether they show it or not. The problem is
it seems that they <B><I>don't</I></B> show it, and don't have any
real inspiration to show it, which just makes me think that I could
have a not-very-inspiring conversation with a cool person, or I could
go install fluorescent light bulbs, and probably enjoy both about the
same. That makes me sound so evil. It makes it sound like I'm not
really there to be with people, but just to philosophize or
theologize about some great inspirational topic or something. I
dunno...I wanna be more than just an engineer, and more than just an
encyclopedia or Bible quiz book, because there's more to life than
those. But I want to do more than watch shootemup movies all the time
too and do more than watch other people have what I&nbsp;think are
better friendships than I do. I want to *live* and live with my
heart, and want people to take that journey with me, and I'm not sure
there are many people at the moment who really "get"&nbsp;that, and
even less who get it and express it the same way I do.</P>

<P>Blah blah blah. Maybe I&nbsp;should stop writing and just sit here
and absorb the nature music. Yeah I&nbsp;think I'll do that. And try
to develop a proper Christmas attitude while I'm at it. Reach for the
beyond, for the eternal perspective, to feel something in my heart,
and all that good stuff. It'll do me good. So that's all for me now
on this topic. Maybe if I get it all figured out I'll report back.
:-) Haha, I'll be back before then I'm sure, because who ever has
this stuff all figured out?</P>
