<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00AF00">Well, tonight was that joyous occasion
known as the Super Bowl, when millions of people stare at their
television screens to watch a few men battle each other in a
controlled fury; a foolishness compounded by the fact that few of
these onlookers actually have anything to benefit from the game or
its outcome, except for the bragging rights to say, "My team
won!!!"</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#D6D600">To celebrate the glorious Super Bowl
XXXI, I spent this afternoon at my church youth group's Super Bowl
Party. In addition to watching the game on the living room television
of a church member's home, there was also indoor swimming, Billiards
(pool), and a cool 200 MHz computer to entertain us. I spent most of
my time playing pool or watching people use the computer, instead of
simply watching the game. But I did see enough of the game to observe
the reactions of the other teens.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00AF00">Three teens from the same family, who
coincidentally have the last name of "Packer," were cheering from
start to finish for - you guessed it - the Packers. When the final
score was announced - 35 to 21, the Packers over the Patriots - there
was a mild uproar as there were shouts of "Yeah..." "We are the
champions..." blah, blah, blah. I was a little happy for them because
the Packers won, but I really didn't care myself which team
won.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#D6D600">What I saw tonight at this church party
was how self-centered and uncaring people can be. I could concentrate
on comments made to me such as, "Will you just leave? If you think I
like you, I don't, you know." But that is off the subject, so I'll
forget about that little put-down. What I will concentrate on is how
people will yell and holler and scream about something essentially
unimportant, and yet not realize and work for things that are
important. What is the relative value of a football game? Yes, as a
Christian, I know that Christians on football teams have a great
medium to share their faith. That's great for the players. But why
should I, Joe American, get so excited (positively or negatively),
about a game that can't affect my life directly? Football is a game -
a GAME - like playing Scrabble or Uno or Monopoly. Sure it's great to
win, but it isn't worth bragging about for ages and ages. If you
actually played in the game, then it must be a great feeling to win
the Super Bowl, and perhaps the actual players do have a reason to
brag. But again, as Joe American, what would I have to brag about?
Did I do anything that helped the team to win? Am I to be hailed as
great if my team wins? Am I to be chastised if my team
doesn't?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00AF00">The serenade of "We are the champions..."
was a little irritating, based on these realizations of mine. I could
have said, "No, you are not the champions; the Green Bay Packers are
the champions; you are simply a viewer, a supporter." But surely that
would have created a great deal of wrath against me from the sports
fanatics, so "...break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue."
(</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#00AF00">Hamlet</FONT></I><FONT

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#D6D600">In preparation for this great party
tonight, my thoughts were that although I wasn't real excited about
the game, I would enjoy the time because of the "social contact" I
would be able to gain. And of course it was good for me to be around
other Christians from my youth group. But it was comments like the
aforementioned "Will you just leave; we don't want you around" that
caused pain for me. People can be excited over nothing, but at the
same time totally disregard the importance of the "finer" things of
life - encouragement, friendship, joy, etc. Call me an intellectual
and sentimental, but to have one call me "friend" is a much greater
accomplishment than to see "my team" win a football game, even the
Super Bowl.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00AF00">These are my comments for the day. I
realize that these are to many folks out there politically and
socially incorrect. And so I'm offering you the chance to respond.
Assuming your response does not contain any profanity or other
undesirable language, I'll even post your response here on this page.
So if you have a comment, </FONT><FONT
