<P>As I&nbsp;was enjoying today's warm weather (upper 40s) by walking
around Cedar Lake, I began to think about an unusual topic: smell. We
talk about beautiful images and melodic sounds and scrumptious
morsels, but maybe we sometimes forget about the sense of smell. I'd
like to share a little about my experiences with this sense, just for
the record. While I know this is a strange topic, please try and take
it seriously, because I am not saying these things sarcastically.</P>

<P>Cedar Rapids has often been called "the city of five smells". This
has always been a derogatory comment based on the several factories
and the former meat packing plant here in town. Now, I guess I don't
really disagree with the fact that Cedar Rapids is a smell-or-iffic
place. What I guess I'd like to propose is maybe that array of smells
is not a bad thing.</P>

<P>For the record, some of the more memorable smells of Cedar Rapids
are: ADM Corn Sweeteners smell (bitter corn), the General Mills smell
(Crunch Berries), the Quaker Oats smell (sometimes oatmeal-ish,
sometimes the bitter corn-ish), the Diamond V Mills smell (yeast),
the garbage dump smell from the new Cedar River trail south of Czech
Village, and formerly the Farmstead Foods packing plant smell. Each
of these smells is distinct and holds a certain amount of memories
for me. I'm not saying these smells are *great* or anything, but for
me they hold a certain appeal. It's sorta like Data on Star Trek when
he first experienced a taste he didn't like. When asked how it
tasted, he said, "It's revolting!" When asked if he wanted more, he
said, "Yes please!" That's when experiencing a sensation is more
important than the relative like or dislike of the sensation. Does
that make any sense?</P>

<P>I think the memories aspect is the key ingredient for my
appreciation of the smells around me. When I smell the bitter corn, I
am reminded of the days when I was 10-15 and my parents and I would
go sometimes nearly every night to ADM to watch the CRANDIC road
train prepare and leave for Iowa City. I have images in my mind of
watching the train approach, of waiting for 20 minutes or sometimes
an hour for the train crew to do their switching, and then feeling
the excitement when the train (finally!) came back out from ADM and
came by once more on their way to Iowa City. I am still fond of these
childhood memories, even though times change and the train doesn't go
to Iowa City anymore and I've found other ways to spend my time.
These trainwatching times were times of bonding with my parents, as
well as a chance to get away for a bit from schoolwork or whatever
else needed to be done. So, if you think I'm crazy when I say that
ADM&nbsp;doesn't smell bad, now you know why.</P>

<P>When I smell the crunchberries smell in the air, I am reminded of
more trainwatching. While the CRANDIC&nbsp;train was at ADM, we would
often drive a few miles west to CNW's (now UP's) Beverly yard and
watch the trains there. Sometimes we saw the crazy-fast through
trains go by, bringing coal or trailers or corn products or
containers from lands far away by my sight. These were, in a way, a
strong connection with the world, even from a young age. I used to
keep track of train car numbers and think about where they were from
-- coal from out west, box cars from the south, engines from the
Chicago yard. These thoughts gave me a chance to think outside the
bounds of my Cedar Rapids kid existence. I don't know if I thought
about it that much at the time, but I think it had a part in shaping
who I&nbsp;am now. So the crunchberries are special to me as
well.</P>

<P>When I&nbsp;smell the Quaker Oats bittersweetness, I am reminded
of the many many bike riding adventures across town. After
discovering the Cedar Lake trail, I often would ride across town to
ride on the trail. Often while riding by Quaker I would see a
CNW/UP&nbsp;or Chicago Central (or CRANDIC, on especially rare and
happy occasions) train switching in the yard. Again, the trains would
"enthuse" me, and I would entertain myself by watching them and their
raw but controlled power. With every breath of that trainwatching, I
was smelling the Quaker Oats aroma, and good or bad, those two sense
memories are intertwined in my mind. Today I still often journey out
on the Cedar Lake trail, and the nearby Quaker Oats smells still
remind me of the pleasant trainwatching and bike riding of years
past.</P>

<P>The Diamond V Mills smell reminds me of other bike riding
adventures. It was not frequent, but occasionally a train would make
its way from Quaker to Beverly, and I would chase it by bike partway
across town. That trek took me by Diamond V Mills, with its
characteristic yeasty smell. On other occasions, while bike riding to
Ellis Park I would smell the same smell, and laugh to myself about
the utter unlikeableness of the smell. But, like it or not, it is a
marker in my mind reminding me of the good times God has blessed me
with.</P>

<P>One final memorable smell: A few years ago they built and paved a
trail from Czech Village in SW Cedar Rapids to Tait Cummins Park.
Along that trail is one of the city's two garbage dumps. Needless to
say, when the wind is blowing in the right direction, there is a
very, um, pungent smell at times while on that trail. But, that smell
now, especially while riding on the trail, reminds me of the many
evening rides I've had in the past few years on that trail, how I
would ride the length of that stretch and back, and make my way home
via the cool slick method by riding down the small roads and up the
hill through the cemetery to avoid traffic.</P>

<P>Now, for completeness -- as for Farmstead Foods, I just barely
remember that factory, so its smell is almost outside my scope of
memory. I can't imagine that I would have liked that smell, but since
I like these other "great" smells, who knows?</P>

<P>So, I think that for the sense of smell, like the other senses, we
find pleasure and meaning from things that remind us of things past.
This has a sort of a cascading effect in our lives I&nbsp;think. From
early childhood we are exposed to certain things. When we attach
positive memories with those early sensations, and then are
re-exposed to the same sensations, we re-remember the memories, which
makes the association that much stronger. This is a bit psychological
I guess, but it makes sense to me. I guess one of the many questions
I think about but sadly never ask people is if they have similar
memories, or if I am alone in my crazy smellorificness.</P>

<P>These thoughts make me thankful and a bit amazed at how God has
placed these things in our hearts (in mine at least), that there is a
sort of perpetual, self-reinforcing joy from these sorts of memories
and senses. Our experiences build our memories, and while we are
making new experiences every day, we have these triggers in our mind
that trigger the memories of the past. I know this is true for both
good and bad memories, but I've chosen to focus on the positive ones
tonight. How blessed we are to be able to build such a repertoire of
positive memories, if we choose to be aware of them.</P>

<P>Now, I've made a list of just some of the more weird smells in my
life. I have not even begun to describe many of the rest of them --
the newly mown grass smell, the electric motor model train smell, the
diesel smoke train smell, the October leaves smell, the garden dirt
smell, the August grasshoppers smell -- I'm sure you could add many
of your own to this list. And, I guess the point is, I hope you will.
Maybe it's too weird, but maybe not. How many memories do you have
that are somehow related to the "smells of life"? Think about
it....</P>

<P>Okay, that's all for now. Thanks for bearing with me -- I know the
topic of "I like random smells" is rather weird. But it's something
to think about, and at least maybe you'll understand a little better
why I say, "ADM bitter corn smell? Ahhhh...smells like my childhood."
