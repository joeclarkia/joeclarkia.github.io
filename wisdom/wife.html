<P>I'm sure you've heard of it before....a hopeful and youthful
teenager or young adult dreams about the day when they will not be
alone. Some have friends on every side, and some have none; some are
radiant with beauty, some are not; but all are searching for
something...for someone to be their companion, to share the joys and
sorrows of life with, someone to grow in Christ with, someone to
personally spur them on toward love and good deeds. And so, in the
spirit of dreaming, these young ones create lists of just what they
hope for in a mate, what qualities they will judge their
acquaintances by to see if perhaps each one might be Mr. or Ms.
"Right."</P>

<P>Well, a similar sort of thing goes on in my mind. Recently, a
group of friends decided it would be fun and exciting for each of us
to make a list of what we look for in a potential mate. At first
creating this list seemed to be a compilation of the things I believe
to be important to me, and little else. And it's true that most of
these are things that I hold in high regard for myself. And although
they say that "opposites attract" and that spouses complement each
other in their differences, I still stand by my list of qualities
here. These are things I think are important (to one degree or
another), and I would have serious questions about any proposed
spouse who did not share these ideas. Surely, there are enough
differences in the details of life to make life interesting and to
help us complement each other.</P>

<P>So without further adieu, my LIST:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>1. A Christian.</B></FONT> This is, as they
say, a "no-brainer." Because I am a Christian, and because my
guidebook the Bible tells me "Do not be unequally yolked," I state
this as my top priority. I believe it is safe to say that a choice of
faith (whatever that faith is in, even if it's in nothing at all)
will rule a person's life. So if I and my spouse are to be heading in
the same direction at all, I believe she would need to be a
Christian. And, I might add, not just a "Sure I'm a Christian, I
guess, I go to church just like my parents told me to" so-called
Christian. There is a difference. Even though one who says this may
appear to be somewhere on the Christian road, most likely if they are
only holding on to childhood teachings, without any realization that
Jesus is a real, relevant, important part of adult life as well, then
they are not really following Jesus as fully as He would like. Sure,
people change, but people more often do not. Wagering the rest of my
life on an assumption that someone is going to change is not wise, in
my opinion.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>2. Good Listener.</B></FONT> This is another
"no-brainer," I suppose. You often see this item in other lists such
as this one. What do I mean by it? Well, I think that I often have
interesting ideas to share, or a unique perspective on life, but
don't have anyone really to share it with. Or if I do, I expect them
to say, "That's nice," and not really listen to what I say. So I'm
looking for someone who will be interested in how and what I think,
who wants to draw out of me the stuff that "makes me tick." And I'm
not looking for a mute listener, either. Mutual sharing is the ideal
-- someone who can listen to what I say, match it up with a similar
(or even opposing but related) situation in their mind or their life,
and shed new light on a subject by such communication. I'm looking
for someone who will show me, for once, that it's possible to be
completely honest and not fear condemnation because of honesty.</P>

<P>Added Dec 2001: Just to be clear, I'm not expecting to be a
motormouth here. I'm looking for someone who is a good listener, of
course, but as you might guess with a wish like that, I realize the
importance of being a good listener myself. Trusted sources have said
that I am a good listener (references available upon request), and I
hope to continue that character trait in the future.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>3. Christian Music Preferences.</B></FONT> I
personally prefer a variety of music to listen to, with biases toward
such quiet/thoughtful artists as Michael Card and Steve Green.
However, I do not mind some "mixed" bands like Petra. What bothers me
about the people I see today is this: high schoolers I see listen to
rock Christian music, almost exclusively, and whine incessantly if
forced to listen to anything else. College students (my peer group
right now), listen to soft rock secular music, which has value, but
is, well, not Christian, and I personally think that Christian music
is a big part of growing as a Christian. It is the few "older young
adults" (in their 30s or later) that listen to "quiet" Christian
music, as in music that focuses on meaning, not drumbeats. Now, I
guess my greatest goal is to find meaning in the words of the song,
combined with the melody, and that's what I'm looking for in a mate
-- someone who values meaning, no matter what the package.</P>

<P>Added Dec 2001: Over the last year or two, my music preferences
have broadened a bit. I have begun listening to a soft rock radio
station (can we say, "Delilah") and, on occasion, the local pop rock
station. Most of my previous thoughts remain intact; I still value
music for its meaning, and not so much for it's style alone. But, I
see that secular music can have value as well. Some secular music is
rather evil and I try to avoid it. But there is a good deal of it
that has a good "moral" to it, or tells a story that is so close to
my own heart that I can't bring myself to think badly of it. So in
one sense I prefer a mate who enjoys Christian music, but I also
would like someone who can see the value in some secular music as
well.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>4. Computer Literacy.</B></FONT> Obviously,
this is not as important as some other issues. But, being a computer
engineer, I would find joy in finding someone who has some
appreciation of computers...someone, even, who has some fascination
with them, someone who would not be forced to say, "There goes Joe
again, playing with his SE-30s in the basement," but someone who
would say, "Let's have a date fixing the SE-30s" and share in my
computer-ness. Hey, I can always wish, right?</P>

<P>Added Dec 2001: Just to keep up with technology, in case any of
you are wondering: No, I don't make a habit of playing with SE-30s
anymore. The baseline tends to be a PC&nbsp;of about 133 or 200 MHz.
But the principle of computer literacy still stands as a "wish".</P>

<P>Added Dec 2005: While I still have a special spot in my heart for
computers, I am thinking that... my life has become more well-rounded
since I originally wrote this one. Life is about so much more than
playing with tools for their own sake. So, my goal is about
appreciating my interests, and understanding when I want to go
administrate my Linux server, but not necessarily to the extent of
having a "his" and "hers" Linux installation -- such a state is not
likely, and now I'm not sure whether I'd really want that anyway.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>5. Savor the Moment.</B></FONT> This is one of
my mottoes in life. Someone whom I intend to savor the rest of my
life with, I think, should have some appreciation of "savoring the
moment." What I mean is this: Picture a sunset. There are dishes to
be done, or maybe food to be eaten, or (scary) children to be put to
bed, or exercises to do, or whatever. But I value someone who can
stop, and say, "Wow...look at that sunset" -- someone whose mind can
be interrupted from the normal pace of life by something as simple,
yet so amazing and beautiful, as a sunset or a sunrise, or so many
other "simple pleasures" of life.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>6. Honesty.</B></FONT> Yes, another commonly
wished-for trait. But as I mentioned earlier, I value honesty. All
the time I see (or think I see) the results of deceit and dishonesty
around me. From someone ignoring a problem, thinking it will go away,
to someone lying to cover their tracks (those of you who watch
"Friends" may realize that that whole show is about covering up how
they really think and/or act when it may jeopardize their friendships
with others), dishonesty is common, maybe not in it's blatant form,
but it's more coercive form. What I'm looking for is someone who
doesn't buy into the "Time heals all wounds" -- implying they should
be ignored -- idea, someone who instead believes in restoring broken
relationships, and really thinks that honesty is the best policy.
This is, admittedly, still a ... not-set-in-stone ... principle of
mine. Maybe honesty isn't best. But I'd like to find someone who
believes (like I think I do) that it is the best, in the long run,
who believes that there is such a thing as reconciliation, and has a
lifestyle to prove it.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>7. Humor--?.</B></FONT> Oh, what a bittersweet
role humor plays in our little lives. I find that many people are
rampaging through life, looking for some reason to laugh or make a
joke about something, even if that something has no real
significance. While I don't mind a good joke now and then, I often
find useless, pointless humor annoying. I have long thought about the
value of a national day of mourning, like the Israelites had. There
are many many days to enjoy life, why not one or two set aside to
"ponder" about the deeper things in life. These are not always the
things that bring an "easy come easy go" smile to our faces, but are
the things that will enrich our lives later on, and allow us to
"expand our minds" and see a little bit more fully how God has worked
in the past, and how He works in the world today, and in each of us.
How does this relate to a spouse? Well, good question. I believe what
I'm looking for here is someone who can enjoy a joke, but also knows
when a joke is inappropriate, and knows the value of solemnity when
it's appropriate.</P>

<P>Added Dec 2001: I find in my life that my attitude towards humor
changed rather dramatically during college. Before college, I was at
times...frustrated...about people and things in life, and so I saw
little value in the flippant humor that goes on in the world. Through
my experiences, perhaps from trying to get attention, or perhaps just
"growing up" in college, I have found a greater appreciation for
humor, and for those of you that know me, you would not be surprised
that some people now call me the "king of cheesy jokes". So I have a
strange sense of humor still, but I do find value in it. At times, I
think I place too much emphasis on it, and am tempted to crack some
stupid joke at an inappropriate time; such an action would go against
my principles, and perhaps it's an area I need to work on. There's a
balance that I'm always striving for. As I said originally, I'm
looking for someone who values a joke, and can laugh at jokes,
especially the nacho cheese ones, and yet knows when to be serious,
and doesn't treat everything in life as one crazy joke.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8. No Divorce.</B></FONT> Here's a popular
discussion topic. Perhaps it is my inexperienced, youthful idealism
showing through, but I'm hoping not.... I want to find someone who
will take their vows seriously...someone who, when she says, "till
death do us part," really means it, and not "till I get tired of it,"
or "till life gets hard." I want to find someone who will commit,
along with me, that divorce is not and never will be an option. Yes,
that's scary, because no one knows what the future holds. But we know
the future-holder (God), and I want to find someone who will agree
that He's big enough to keep us together. Included in this idea, I'm
looking for someone who is passionate about keeping their
commitments...someone with integrity, someone whose word is their
bond, as they say. It should be obvious that this rules out a good
deal of people who have been married previously and/or have
children.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>9. Bible Discussions.</B></FONT> Perhaps this
is due to my parents' influence. But that's okay. In my dreams, who
knows the limit of what conversations would transpire? But one thing
seems clear: I find joy in discussing Biblical passages that I find
uplifting, or troubling, or confusing, and hearing what others think
about them. This is one of the true cases of, ideally at least, two
people drawing closer to each other by drawing closer to God through
the study and careful discussion of His Word. What an ideal that is!
Also, I would hope to find someone who tries to find "real-world"
applications of Bible topics...someone who looks for ways to apply
what she learns in the Bible to modern-day life.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>10. Material Possessions (Not).</B></FONT> If
you're familiar with the story of Mary and Martha, you'll know what I
mean, kind of. Mary was the one sitting at the feet of Jesus, hanging
on every word that he said, while Martha was in the kitchen
feverishly trying to cook the meal and wanting Mary to help her. But
Jesus valued Mary's thirst for living water over Martha's quest to
fix the best banquet. That somehow applies to material possessions as
well. I've seen and heard about some women (and men too, obviously)
who treat as their "gods" everything from money to cars to careers to
houses to jewelry, etc. Those are not my aspirations. Of course I
value cars, houses, and jobs. But I would hope to find someone who
realizes like me that these things are only temporary .. only dust,
and seeks to sink their effort into things that will last. I have not
completely learned that trait of life myself, so it may be a mutual
pursuit. But I'm seeking someone who seeks to be content with less
than the best, someone who doesn't always have to be the first, to be
the pacesetter with the newest car, the biggest house, or the most
jewelry.</P>

<P>Added Dec 2001: You may think that the words in the previous
paragraph are only those of a poor college student, but surprisingly
(even to myself at times), my frugality has survived six months of
work at a well-paying job. I now have more means to spend without
discretion, if I chose to, but still I find that my priorities are
generally not in what most folks consider "the finer things in life."
Yes, I do tend to eat at more non-McDonalds restaurants these days,
but these are usually social occasions and I go for the social
interaction with coworkers or friends and not so much for the food,
especially for the "superior quality" food of finer restaurants. I've
realized that I'm very non-picky about food, and the$3 McDonalds
hamburger/fries deal seems about the same as the $7 one from a more
expensive place. Put another way, I'd prefer to save the extra $4 to
spend on some computer equipment or (cheesy) to buy a gift for
someone special, rather than waste it on transitory food. It's not
that I'm adverse to spending money, if the cause is right. I just
have different priorities about what's worth spending money on and
what's not. I have learned to share in the extravagant ways of "the
world" when appropriate, but the world has not converted me yet.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>11. Feminisist Radicalism (Not).</B></FONT>
Another popular topic. I see a "happy medium" being best here. I
don't feel drawn to someone who makes it their goal to subvert
"males" at every turn, to show those "chauvinistic pigs" where their
proper place is. On the other hand, I'm not drawn to the "barefoot
and pregnant" idea (I don't suppose many women out there are,
either!). Like I said, happy medium -- what I mean, I guess, is
equality -- social and spiritual. I seek someone who will realize
that God has given a man and a woman different responsibilities in
the home and family, but that neither is inherently "better" and
neither should be domineering towards the other. The spirit should be
one of cooperation, not one of "I'm better than you."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>12. In-Laws.</B></FONT> I find it hard to
believe (in a way) that in-laws are as evil as spouses say and imply
they are. I hope to work hard to build strong bonds with my future
wife's parents, probably long before marriage is in the picture.
Perhaps this becomes a little less important as potential mates in my
age group begin to become independent of their parents and strike out
on their own. But as long as there are parents, I think it's my job
to make every effort to be in good standing with them.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>13. The Wedding.</B></FONT> How can I say this?
I think that traditional weddings are in a way too ... ceremonial. I
think that family and friends place too much emphasis on the details
of a wedding. I think (and am hoping my future spouse will agree)
that the ceremony should focus on the new couple, their vows to each
other, and the seriousness and joy of the commitment they are making,
and not on the cute little flower girl or the ring-bearer who drops
the ring or the aunt who has to take 15 rolls of film, etc. Sure,
these are all a part of the ceremony, but they are also distractions
from the real point. Don't get me wrong -- I hope to have a
meaningful wedding, but I hope the meaning will come from the vows
and the shared words of love, not the meaningless details.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>14. "A time to be silent."</B></FONT> When
looking for a wife (or for any companion, really), I look for someone
who realizes that there are times that are not appropriate for
conversation. Specifically, at a church worship service or similar
gathering, I look for someone who would not take offense if I seem to
be distracted or even seem to be ignoring them. This may be
common-sense, but I often wonder when sitting next to a good friend,
or a potentially good friend, "Do they think I'm ignoring them?" This
of course is not the case -- usually I am very happy that they chose
to sit next to me. But at that moment, I feel it my responsibility to
keep my focus on the speaker or the event at hand. I usually do not
mind an occasional comment, especially if it pertains to what's being
discussed, but my response will probably not be as "polite" as it
would be if there were no other event occurring. One thing to note
about this: Because I shy away from socializing during worship
services, I sometimes wish there were more times set aside for
"socially spiritual" conversations at church. Often, as soon as the
service ends, either 1) everyone leaves, or 2) the conversation
immediately devolves into everyday conversation. It would be most
beneficial, I believe, to be able to savor the moment of God's
presence for just a moment, while everyone has the sermon and/or
worship experience fresh in their minds. So relating this to a future
wife once more, I am looking for someone who understands my lack of
response during a church service, but is willing and eager to discuss
the events and discussions of the service once the service is
complete. Ahhh, what a happy thought. :-)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>15. </B></FONT><I>(Added Dec
2002)&nbsp;</I><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Intrigued with My "Wise
Thoughts."</I></B></FONT><I> As I go on in life, I see that my "wise
thoughts" archive (of which this is a part) becomes more and more a
major outlet for "the real me". Even as I go back and read past wise
thought entries, I am struck with how I can still relate to them, and
how each one helps paint a clearer picture of who I have been, who
I&nbsp;am, who I am becoming, and who I want to be. I am stricken to
the point that I think that "the right one" would need to have a
healthy appreciation for these little snippets of my mind, since they
do record some of the deepest and most heart-felt pieces of my being.
I long for someone who will take these writings as...dare I say
"precious" things, even if they are open to the world to read (or
maybe partly *because* of that fact). I long for someone who
will...anxiously await the next installment of "my inner thought
life", and (this is important) be eager to discuss some or most of
the articles. I can write all day, and that in itself is useful and
helpful to me, but my "dream" is that someday someone will take an
interest in the&nbsp;Joe that is represented by these essays, not
just by the crazy Joe or the funny Joe or the silly Joe that I can be
on the surface.</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Conclusion.</B></FONT> Well, there you have it
-- my LIST of desirable traits that seem to influence who I find
"attractive" and who I look to as a potential future spouse. As I
implied earlier, in some ways these traits are a combination of what
I like in my own life, and the opposite of the things I don't. So
some things (the more subjective ones) are debatable, and perhaps
finding someone who is not identical may be beneficial (although I
don't see that being true from my perspective). However, other items
(like finding a Christian who is growing and does not consider
divorce an option) seem to be foundational principles, and I would be
foolish, I think, to compromise them at all.</P>
