         time at least was as simple as eating from a certain tree in
         Eden? Seems like almost a. .. mythological ... statement,
         more mythological than our ideas about eternal life
         today</FONT></P>

         says explicitly that the woman was (I&nbsp;guess this is the
         first instance where the woman's actions are implied by the
         man's actions). Was this implicit man-over-woman idea
         present before the Fall, or did the Fall have something to
         do with this as well?</FONT></P>
