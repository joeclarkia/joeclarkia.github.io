<P>So, I&nbsp;see a pattern. It's an old pattern, but I have been
reminded of it again in my present life. The pattern is that I
realize that I am not one who thrives in large groups. I&nbsp;see
clearly that I&nbsp;do much better in smaller groups (less than 10
people, and depending on the people, sometimes less than 5). In large
groups, I tend to play the silent role, only speaking on occasion,
and usually not really being a part of the overall conversation. I
also play the passive role, not really trying to sway the actions of
the group or convince anyone of anything. This is an area in which
I've not changed much over the years. On the other hand, I think I've
made progress in being more interesting and more friendly in
one-on-one or small group settings, so I&nbsp;think I do have
something to offer to people, it's just..hidden.. sometimes.</P>

<P>Now, for the history lesson. In high school, the best example was
the youth group. I was a member of the youth group, but I didn't
associate with the other members a whole lot. I did feel connected to
the youth group, but mostly because I helped some of the youth
leaders with things like the weekly newsletter (categorize that as
"respected"). But as far as purely socially fitting in, it was never
firmly decided. In college, I&nbsp;was involved in two groups, one
big and one small. It was quite interesting (and this may be
something I've never said before except to myself) that the first
weeks of college were interesting. I&nbsp;enjoyed the larger group
more I&nbsp;think, and it was only after a few months that I started
going more to the smaller group. Over time, though, I&nbsp;began to
feel like the smaller group was really "my group", and the larger
group was the group I&nbsp;went to, and really enjoyed, but wasn't
really part of the "in" crowd (no it's not a clique, but you know
what I&nbsp;mean). Now, recently, I've found myself a part of another
large group, and I finally decided I feel the same way about it that
I felt about the large(ish) group in college. I think in both cases,
the people are plenty friendly and plenty willing to allow new people
in and value them and all that. But I&nbsp;think that I still act in
whatever way I do such that other people in the group go on about
their lives, the status quo being that I'm there, and they don't
mind, but they really spend their time on more
"interesting"&nbsp;people (you know, the people who actually
talk).</P>

<P>So that's my judgment of my situation. Is it an unfair judgment?
Quite possibly. Should I&nbsp;amend it?&nbsp;Maybe. What I do see, in
this group and every other one, is that I&nbsp;"thrive", if you will,
on one-on-one conversation, or, alternatively, on a small, focused
conversation of a few people. A bit of structure (but not too
much)&nbsp;helps. But I think that most people are too busy to make
that effort, or have already determined "who I am" and how they will
relate to me. Is that true? Do you think people, when they meet new
people, observe them for a bit of time and then decide how they will
relate to them in the future? It is basically restating the cliche
"You only have one chance to make a good first impression." Well,
anyway, I don't think I give good first impressions to most people,
so they have to work harder if they want to find out why I'm worth
their time. So is it fair to other people to make them work harder? I
lack clue. Is this whole topic a kind of judging people, that thing
we're not supposed to do? Probably. But are they being the judge for
determining how to relate to me based on only, say, 30 words of
conversation, or am I being the judge for judging them and saying
they judge me? I have no idea, but I think I think too much. :-)</P>

<P>Now of course, there are plenty of action steps I could take and
things I could do and positive self image boosting I could do and all
that stuff to make myself more appealing to people. I'm sort of
waffling about that too. Simple example: Should I spend more time
making my hair "look good" so people know that I care about myself
and how I&nbsp;look? I dunno. Someone did some hair styling and
filled my mind with thoughts of caring about my hair last night, but
the first comment today was that it wasn't that great (because my
stupid hair sticks out in the morning...bleh). Maybe I just need
training in how to "look good". Or maybe I&nbsp;should just continue
to be who I am, take it or leave it, realizing that people are
predisposed to leave it anyway. So the question is...with regard to
this perceived problem with myself, is it really a problem that
I&nbsp;need to (or can) deal with, or is it something I&nbsp;should
just accept as my personality and move on with life, realizing that
we all have our own burdens to carry?</P>

<P>I dunno. I think I make decent friendships with a buncha people in
small venues.. I don't think I&nbsp;have any real enemies, and I
don't think there are many people that really dislike me. But is that
because I am "a beautiful butterfly" (random) or is it just because
my "true nature"&nbsp;is not seen by very many people? Am I
tolerated, or am I&nbsp;respected, or am I loved? Frequent question.
Also an invitation to be judgmental (stupid me).</P>

<P>Anyway, as I said on my xanga site tonight (in elusive form),
I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;really am "worth the effort" but I can be easily
overlooked too. I&nbsp;think that changing how I act in groups may
not be possible or may not be the best use of my time. I am what
I&nbsp;am. But that should not be an excuse, and I should always keep
a careful eye out for specific things I&nbsp;can do or say to improve
myself and to let the large groups of people know that I do actually
do something besides sit there.</P>

<P>Disclaimer: If you find yourself in one of the groups
I&nbsp;generically mentioned, well... don't be too alarmed at my
jaded views on these subjects. Realize that these writings are my
outlet for what I think deep down, and they're not always polished or
"right". Just a "Joe in progress." Moods change. And try to perhaps
understand that 1) I'm talking about groups in general, and not any
people in particular, and 2)&nbsp;I'm talking mostly about my
response to life and my response to the people in it, not really
about how other people act. I'm annoyed at myself that I don't make
myself do what it takes, and I don't think it's really fair to expect
other people to go arounding searching me out in spite of my
shortcomings -- I wish they would, but it's on the verge of being
selfish to expect it. Bleh. Maybe I'll have more of a clue on this
topic later.</P>
