</I></B></FONT><I>Joe Clark</I></CENTER>

<P>Since mid-2004 or so, I've been interested in the writings of
Thomas Merton. Merton was a <I>contemplative</I> Trappist monk in the
mid 20th century. He had a lot of good things to say I think. Most of
the statements are things I am already aware of in some sense, but he
says them in such a way that they come alive to me in new ways.</P>

<P>Unlike a lot of the usual "great and awesome" books of our time,
which often just restate what we all expect to hear, this book runs
with some of the paradoxes I think about. He says things that just
make sense to me, even though you don't hear them stated this way in
our pop culture version of church. I would go so far as to say that
Merton's writings have "changed my life"&nbsp;more than any other
book I've read, save for the Bible itself. His tone reminds me of
Michael Card, who makes much of paradox and contemplation in his
music I think. Look for those themes in the quotes below, and
I&nbsp;hope they will inspire you to check out his writings.</P>

         <P>For me to be a saint means to be myself &#91;<I>what God
         created me to be</I>&#93;. Therefore the problem of sanctity
         and salvation is in fact the problem of finding out who I am
         and of discovering my true self. Trees and animals have no
         problem. God makes them what they are without consulting
         them, and they are perfectly satisfied. With us it is
         different. God leaves us free to be whatever we like. We can
         be ourselves or not, as we please.</P>

         <P>A tree gives glory to God by being a tree. For in being
         what God means it to be it is obeying Him... It is
         expressing an idea which is in God and which is not distinct
         from the essence of God, and therefore a tree imitates God
         by being a tree.... Therefore each particular being, in its
         individuality, its concrete nature and entity, with all its
         own characteristics and its private qualities and its own
         inviolable identity, gives glory to God by being precisely
         what He wants it to be here and now, in the circumstances
         ordained for it by His Love and His infinite Art.</P>

         <P>Each individual in the mass is insulated by thick layers
         of insensibility. He doesn't care, he doesn't hear, he
         doesn't think. He does not act, he is pushed. He does not
         talk, he produces conventional sounds when stimulated by the
         appropriate noises. He does not think, he secretes
         cliches.</P>

         <P>Who has less to communicate than the mass-man? Very often
         it is the solitary who has the most to say; not that he uses
         many words, but what he says is new, substantial,
         unique.</P>

         <P>Without a certain element of solitude there can be no
         compassion because when a man is lost in the wheels of a
         social machine he is no longer aware of human needs as a
         matter of personal responsibility.</P>

         <P>It is not healthy to be too constantly aware of &#91;our

         <P>If you have never had any distractions you don't know how
         to pray. For the secret of prayer is a hunger for God and
         for the vision of God, a hunger that lies far deeper than
         the level of language or affection.</P>

         <P>For if meditation aims above all at establishing in your
         soul a vital contact of love with the living God, then as
         long as it only produces images and ideas and affections
         that you can understand, feel and appreciate, it is not yet
         doing its full quota of work.</P>

         <P>If you think meditation has done its work when it has
         made you <I>say</I> you love God or <I>feel</I> that you
         love God, then you are still wrong...this is the real end of
         meditation -- it teaches you how to become aware of the
         presence of God; and most of all it aims at bringing you to
         a state of almost constant loving attention to God, and
         dependence on Him.</P>

         <P>Indeed, too often the weakest thing about our faith is
         the illusion that our faith is strong, when the "strength"
         we feel is only the intensity of emotion or of sentiment,
         which have nothing to do with real faith.</P>

         <P>Celebration is not for the alone. ... Celebration is not
         noise. It's not a spinning head. It is not just individual
         kicks. It is the creation of a common identity, a common
         consciousness. Celebration is everbody making joy. ...
         Celebration is when we let joy make itself out of our love.
         We like to be together. We like to dance together. We like
         to make pretty and amusing things. We like to laugh at what
         we have made. We like to put bright colors on the walls --
         more bright colors on ourselves. We like our pictures, they
         are crazy.</P>

         <P>We are perhaps too talkative, too activistic, in our
         conception of the Christian life. Our service of God and of
         the Church does not consist only in talking and doing. It
         can also consist in periods of silence, listening,
