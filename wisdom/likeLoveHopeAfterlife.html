<P>I have had a number of things on my mind lately. So now it's time
to spew 'em all out. Here goes. We'll see what order emerges, and how
they will all be so skillfully woven together..hopefully.</P>

<P>First of all, a few weeks ago mention was made to me about my
little jaunts into expectations and love and sappy romanticness and
all that stuff. Specifically, those thoughts were placed in the
category of "like" and not "love." That took me back a bit, since I
have often contemplated these two "wonderful" words and concepts. At
first, I thought to myself, "How can you judge for me what is like
and what is love?" But, since they have more experience (whatever
that is) than I do, it's also easy to say that they probably know
what they're talking about.</P>

<P>Lately I've been thinking about it off and on though. At times I
think that like and love are really intertwined. It seems as though
love without like is just responsibility and is downright boring. If
like is what gives us emotions and "happiness", then what is love?
The thing that gives us numbness and dreariness and hard sacrifice? I
mean, pardon me but I like my emotions ("like"...maybe my emotions
like my emotions...). To me, life is some sort of precarious balance,
in this case a balance between reasonable and logical loving
decision-making and crazy silly like feelings. I'm not so sure that
it's entirely accurate to say, "Love is a choice" and "like is a
feeling" with the implicit warning, "embrace &#91;boring&#93; love
and banish &#91;exciting&#93; like." Basically, I want both. I want
to have the emotion, but temper it with the realism that the
commitments bring.</P>

<P>Now, on the other hand, I also got to thinking about that lovely
love chapter, I Corinthians 13. What does *God* say that love is?
Let's list the attributes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>patient, kind, not envious, not boastful, not proud,
   not rude, not self-seeking, not easily angered, keeps no record of
   wrongs, does not delight in evil, rejoices with the truth,
   protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Okay, so that's my standard. Now, let's contemplate, with as much
honesty as I can muster, how do my times of "like", or
I-can't-believe-it's-not-love measure up to that? Just in
general...</P>

<UL>
   <LI>patient: oops. If I want joy or happiness or love, obviously I
   want it now, if not yesterday. I can wait, maybe, but not very
   easily, and not really very long without being stupid.</LI>
   
   <LI>kind: I'd like to think so. But kindness has a way of
   destroying itself in the midst of impatience and the rest of the
   junk that tends to come up. So, while the goal is kindness, the
   result is something far short.</LI>
   
   <LI>not envious: Kidding, right? Call it my evilness, or call it
   my past, but give me something good, and I tend to latch onto it
   way too tightly, fearing that it will flee away leaving only a
   memory of once might have been. I say past, because that's the
   general scheme of things it seems. So I am bitter, but that does
   not excuse me from being envious.</LI>
   
   <LI>not boastful: Okay, I tend not to boast. Except maybe for the
   previous sentence. But really, I don't think I have a problem with
   a big head. Of course, anyone is always welcome to prove me wrong
   if you disagree.</LI>
   
   <LI>not proud: I'm not sure about that one. What is pride? I think
   pride is best found in the other similar results of it which I
   can't think of right now...so I can't say right now whether
   like-love makes me proud or not.</LI>
   
   <LI>not rude: I think I tend to be unrude in most circumstances.
   I&nbsp;may blow up once in a while and shoot people with my words,
   but usually I am fairly low key and "nice" (I&nbsp;hope).</LI>
   
   <LI>not self-seeking: oh how tricky is that one... I say I seek
   the other person's interest, but usually I don't. If I&nbsp;like
   to be liked, then *I* like to be liked. Sure it's about the other
   person, and I feel like I want to be a giving person, but it's
   also about me, making me feel good.</LI>
   
   <LI>not easily angered: maybe. But I do get...frustrated fairly
   easily, and anger and frustration are fairly similar.</LI>
   
   <LI>no record of wrongs: hmm, again maybe. I think I learned a
   long time ago that I am easy to offend, but I am also quick to
   forgive. I guess you might say I'm fickle then. But in a sense I
   do keep a record of wrongs, since I do have past memory of who's
   nice to me and who's not. But I always aim to keep in mind that
   the past is the past, and as always, I'm always open to someone
   changing my mind (that doesn't happen all that often though).</LI>
   
   <LI>does not delight in evil: Hopefully I've got that down. Even
   if I am tempted, I know enough to know that I have to fight
   against whatever evil might present itself. "Hate evil." The
   tricky part is telling the difference between "unwise" and
   downright evil.</LI>
   
   <LI>rejoices with the truth: sure, although maybe not so much when
   it hurts. But, even in the midst of StupidTruth, I still value the
   truth more than some happy-smiley-game or just stony silence.</LI>
   
   <LI>protects: I guess so.</LI>
   
   <LI>trusts: I don't think so. Not as much as I should. Again, the
   bitterness comes into play. Who will not repeat the several
   examples of the past?</LI>
   
   <LI>hopes: sure, only way too much and way too stupidly.</LI>
   
   <LI>perseveres: I sure hope not. If I've learned anything about
   like-love, it's that it is to be carried lightly, and God bless
   the one who invents the on-off switch for the unrequited love (as
   far as I know there is no such blessed trick yet).</LI>
</UL>

<P>Okay, that was long. And that's not even where I'm heading. That
was just a long detour. After thinking about those sorts of
principles, I realized that quite possibly my friends are right, and
like and love are not only separate, in some ways like and love might
be opposites. I want to not believe that, but the evidence is there
in some sense. There is the intense feeling of happiness and such,
but there are also the intensely WRONG feelings of self-seeking,
misplaced hope, etc etc.</P>

<P>Now, I think I've presented both sides of the issue, let me whine
just a bit. Why is life the way it is? :-) Why does love sound so
boring, so filled with duty and responsibility, and why is like so
evil, and why does like lead to nothing but selfishness? Grr. And,
typical of me, why do I tend to judge these topics from afar anyway?
I&nbsp;mean, there is an ebb and flow to my wishes and hopes and
generic desires, but in general I do consider myself lonely
for...something, not even specifically a person, maybe it is all just
longing to "be with Jesus", and if so, then, go me for being godly.
But, bad me, Jesus has not yet appeared in the car seat next to me
while praying, so I guess I hope for some of the next best
things...relationships with people. But they are often difficult,
fraught (is that a word?) with questions and effort and balancing
friendship and like and love, and sometimes in the balance the joy of
the *ship (whatever kind of ship it is, whether friendship or
relationship or nothingship) is dulled, and sometimes by being proper
I think we never really get to know each other. But, on the other
hand, I have learned that over time strong friendships do develop,
even out of the ordinariness.</P>

<P>Now let me switch gears from my normal whining. You wouldn't know
it by reading my "find a wife" sorts of thoughts, but there is
obviously more to love and life than that. Another aspect that I have
thought about some lately is the aspect of caring for aging parents.
I see this sorta similarly to caring for children, but it's not
really all that similar. Kids are small and easy to handle...older
folks are not. Kids cry and want their own way, but it's pretty easy
not to let them have it. Older folks are often quite set in their
ways as well, but since they are our elders we have to think twice
about going against their wishes. The other, more philosophical
difference, is that we know that children are just beginning the
circle of life, just embarking on their journey, while we know deep
down that older folks are nearing the end of the journey, where they
will meet up once again with the beginning of that circle. This is
hard to accept, and really makes us contemplate the...beyondness of
life, which is a good thing in a way. But the beyondness is some
autumnish mixture of gold and brown, of joy mixed with grief, of pain
mixed with anticipation. The responsibilities that come with being
this kind of caregiver are perhaps one of the most frequent signs of
love. The pastor opened his sermon on Sunday by reminding us that
love demands sacrifices. Another hard saying, another chance to have
me think, "Can I for once just enjoy like-love without a reminder of
the grim responsibilities that it always apparently brings?" Anyway,
people who are in the position of caring for aging friends or loved
ones are in a very honorable place I think. It takes a lot of effort,
both mentally and physically, to do what has to be done. Sometimes
it's just simply a messy, mind-numbing job. This honestly scares me a
bit, because I&nbsp;have a feeling that someday I'll be in that
care-giving position, and because of that I need to do at least a
little mental preparation for it. In a more "beyond"&nbsp;sense, it
also reminds me that one day farther along I&nbsp;too may well be in
the position of care-receiver. I think I've always considered loss of
my mental function as the highest of all blows, since I basically am
what I think. I have learned as time has gone on that I&nbsp;am
actually fairly independent. I love to be with people, and to share
my life with them. But I also love time to do my own thing and think
my own thoughts and just (sadly) waste time. I strive for a balance
in this as well. But in the position either as caregiver or
carereceiver, that independence is lost in different ways, and I
would do well to consider that and work a little at not being so
"stuck in the mud"&nbsp;independent.</P>

<P>Now, following my stream of thought, I've also thought some lately
about hope and how it makes itself known to us. I guess I haven't
thought as deeply about this, but somehow in the midst of trying
times healthwise or financialwise or friendwise or Godwise or
anywise, I find that I (and I think anyone) relies on hope to pull
them through. As M. Card says, "Hope is an echo in the air all around
us; it is the sound of heaven's symphony." I can think back to times
in my life where things were bleak in one way or another, and it was
the hope reflex I can remember most clearly. In physical pain I would
look for any tiny sign that normal health may be returning. In
friend/like/love issues I would agonize over things and repeat
conversations to myself trying to grasp some sense of hope about the
situation. In a God sense I will mull over things a lot to try and
find God in the midst of the everydayness of life. All of these
practices are the outcome and outcry of hope. Going back to the
older-folks issues, hope again comes to play in the face of getting
older, having health problems, and not really knowing what the days
ahead may hold. Sure, anyone of us could be dead in 5 seconds, but we
really don't believe it. We are massively desensitized to changes in
our condition by the past. When we have been outliving the 5 second
increments for 10, 20, 30, 50 years...we expect that we will outlive
nearly that number all over again. I have thought for a long time
that I will really know I'm getting old when my thoughts, my life,
and my body stop returning to status quo. See, I realize that change
is inevitable, but in my invincibility I have seen that changes come
and go, but I&nbsp;remain grounded and there are certain things I
have come to rely on -- my health, my family, my closest friends, and
perhaps even just the little things like the town I live in. The
truth is, though, that sooner or later my family will change, my
closest friends may move away, my health may not be what it is now,
and the town I&nbsp;live in may change in any number of drastic ways.
These changes, when they happen or threaten, are what finally kicks
me out of autopilot invincible mode and makes me realize that life is
not just a game, and life is not just day after day and week after
week of cyclical living in a constant state of half-deja-vu, living
out the same basic patterns over and over again. Whether the patterns
are the greatest or the worst, they will not last forever. Change is
all around us, from every decision we make to the slow crumbling of
the mountains into the sea, from the first step we take to the last.
This line of thought is another element of the "beyondness" that is
our life, another tenet that I the beautification engineer would do
well to seek to understand. For true beauty cannot be had without
some understanding of these larger-than-myself principles, these
things that are so hard to grasp, these thoughts that make me think
outside of my small plans and my small life and embrace the ideas of
history, legacy and eternity.</P>

<P>Wow. Finally we get to my final topic. Are you enjoying the rapids
of the stream? Well, thinking about aging issues and like and
love...all of these somehow lead me to the eternal, "beyond this
life" thoughts. For like, I&nbsp;ask myself, "Will this like last
forever. Is this the way it will be?" But I am reminded in one way or
another that like is temporary. Try as I&nbsp;might to sustain it,
for weeks in my case or for years in others' cases, like is simply a
transient. The real question is, is love a transient? Is love
forever? How can we wrap our minds around that question? We know that
God's love is forever, etc. But say, for a couple who may be going
through empty nest syndrome -- can we give them the assurance that
their love is forever? How about for the couple sharing a room in the
nursing home? How about the new parents with the 3-week old newborn?
How about to the single bachelor guy who writes so-called wise
sayings on his computer? (Hey who could that be referring to?) How
can we come to know that the hope we all need, the hope in love in
some sense, will last forever. I feel that I cannot explain this
adequately, probably because no one can even understand the
connections between like/love hope and eternity, let alone explain
them. But I think that we all know that there is some strange
ethereal connection. It reminds me of Morpheous first speaking to Neo
about the Matrix...something about "You cannot explain it, but you
know it is there...you can feel it...." Our world is a Matrix, if you
will, and perhaps just beyond the level of understanding we have is
the "real world" where the true life is to be had, the life with God
and a true understanding of such things as love and hope and life
eternal. I for one strive for that understanding, although not always
as wholeheartedly as I should. I strive for the perspective to see
that this Matrix of a life is just the beginning, just the first
dimension of something more vast and more grand than I can even
fathom.</P>

<P>What disturbs me about this topic is that eternity is weird. I may
have said this in previous writings, but I think that living forever
is just about as weird and mind-blowing as not living forever. I am
*SO&nbsp;MUCH*&nbsp;a product of human life and a human brain that I
cannot even begin to think about what everlasting life is. If there
is anything that can seem to drive me crazy, not just headache crazy
but just crazy crazy, it is trying to understand eternity. I read
Ecclesiastes, and it seems as though Solomon has given up on
understanding the eternal and settled for describing the mundane life
on earth. I wonder if he suffered from eternity burnout? Perhaps he
too was driven crazy trying to understand the un-understandable?
Well, I hope to never discount the eternal, but I also realize, at
least for now, that I simply cannot understand it, at least not
without God's help, and so I strive to understand a little more, to
get a little better understanding of it, and I, naive as I may be,
seek to understand the eternal by observing bits and pieces of the
people and things and events around me. That is the like, and the
love, and the hope. I like to think that they are all part of the
eternal plan God is working out. Wow. That sounds cliche, but I
really want to expand my mind so it is not...so I am not simply
restating words, but instead expanding my mind to encompass just a
little more of the great vastness of truth that God must have in his
eternalness.</P>

<P>Okay, so how was this for a long winding road of a wise thought?
Fun, huh? If you are still with me, congratulations. Now is your
chance to get out there and live your life, mingling your like and
love and hope with your eternal calling. Go, read your Bible, find
God, and share with those around you the insights you come to
realize. Live your life beyond the half-deja-vu and the cliche. Be
careful to be grounded -- I'm not calling for weirdness and foolish
ideas, but I am calling for, well, wise thinking. "Dream your dreams
with God as King." I hope to encourage careful understanding, the
kind of deepness that can actually make us sit upright and say, "Oh
my goodness!" when we come to realize some new truth or see something
normal as if for the first time in a new light.</P>

<P>Okay, enough lines of cuteness. Go your way, and happy
contemplations. God bless you.</P>
