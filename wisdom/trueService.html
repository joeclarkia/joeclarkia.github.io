<P>Recently the talk of "being used" has been a topic in my mind
(again). It is always a problem of mine, apparently, that I am too
easily persuaded by other people to do what they want me to do. I
have my opinions, and I may be quite annoyed with people who convince
me to do what I don't want to do, but all too often I will give in
and think to myself, "Grrr....oh well." I'm not talking about any
sort of real wrong thing or sin that people convince me to do, but
more just the things in life that I don't really want to do, or the
objects in life that I really don't want to give up. If a sin were at
stake, I would have a good reason to not grant another's request, but
if it is just a worldly object or some of my own time, I guess I have
trouble arguing over and over about why I should disappoint them and
not meet their request.</P>

<P>Anyway, the end result is that some people looking out for my best
interests say that I let people use me. I'm not sure if they're right
or not, but at times I see where that could be implied in my life. Of
course, whenever "being used" is the issue, it is given in a negative
light, and when I think about it in my mind, it is a negative concept
as well. In some cases, being used is sort of a mutual thing, as in I
give something to gain something else, but that's not exactly a
healthy attitude on my part probably, even if it is arguably the
normal state of mind for most people (since we all as humans have
this selfishness problem). Perhaps in a relational way the reason
that being used is seen as a bad thing is that the "user" cares only
about what they can gain from the relationship, and doesn't really
care about the "used" person as a person.</P>

<P>Now, on the other hand.... One of the studies I'm participating in
at the moment deals with service to God ("Serving Lessons"). In
section three especially (the section I'm studying this week), there
is a good deal of talk about using the spiritual gifts and being used
by God. This brought to my mind the thoughts of being used again. The
difference is in this case that "being used"&nbsp;is termed in a
positive light, as long as it's in reference to being used by God. I
could ask a stupid question and say, "Why is it good if God uses me
but bad if other people do?" The answer is that God is not the same
as other people, and, well...you can't apply human rules to God. That
answer -- which is applicable to a good deal of the issues I concern
myself with -- does not really satisfy my inquiring mind, even though
I know it is the right answer. In this case, however, we can say that
God does not fit the description of a "user" because God does care
about us as people, and not just as pawns to accomplish his
purposes.</P>

<P>Well, this is all a bit confusing, and a ripe area for discussion
. In any case, let us assume that being used by God is good, but
being used by other people is bad. Where do we draw the line? Often
the two categories of "being used-age" overlap. We might feel that
God has given us the gift of finances, and so we feel it is our duty,
within reason, to provide for the needs of others -- but where do we
stop? I&nbsp;mean, I could live in a boxcar so others would have nice
places to live. Or if my spiritual gift was singing, I could spend
every weekend touring, visiting other churches and providing special
music. But where then is the consideration for having a home church
to worship in, and for (quite frankly) having free time on weekends
to pursue our hobbies or other interests?</P>

<P>The point here (I think) is that we might be tempted to consider
most of the "being used"&nbsp;by other people as a reflection of our
willingness to be used by God. We can choose to see life as an
opportunity to give ourselves totally away, with no regard for
ourselves *at all*, especially if we remember the "living sacrifices"
verses. But what this would seem to lead to is a classic case of
burnout. Where to draw the line is the problem. Sure we all want and
need to serve people, but at what point is it okay or even in God's
best interests to say no?</P>

<P>After having said this, and hopefully not being too confusing
about it, I guess I would say that I'm looking for opportunities for
true service....well, on second thought, I'm first of all looking for
a definition of true service. Here's a first shot: service that is
ordained by God where a need clearly exists, and service that strives
to reach a goal that is ordained by God. Strangely, that definition
doesn't have any recognition for whether the service is appreciated,
acknowledged or even realized. I guess that means that our service
might go unnoticed, that we might get no compliments in exchange for
our service, and it might even feel at times like we're being used.
And so we must be discerning about when we are "being used" for God's
glory and when we are "being used" because we fail to stop something
that God has not ordained.</P>
