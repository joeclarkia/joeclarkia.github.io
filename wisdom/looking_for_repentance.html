<P>So, I was talking with someone recently about, well, about quite a
few things, but to some degree the conversation began with God's
love, and how extravagant (if unwarranted) that love is, and how so
many don't really understand what God's love is at all. From there we
talked about the sin that so easily entangles, and talked about how
Christians don't always stand up for what they say they believe in.
These thoughts made me stop to reconsider what drives me in relation
to God and me and God's love and sin and repentance.</P>

<P>To help in this search, I looked through my past wise thoughts to
see if I could find one that sorta matched my mood. I didn't look in
depth, but I was a little surprised to find that I couldn't find any
wise thoughts that seemed related. I was looking for something that
addressed a particular thought or series of thoughts, but didn't find
one, so here it is.</P>

<P>I have this potential problem in my life that I ignore everything.
Now, not really everything, but a lot of the stuff that really
matters. I on one hand think that I'm fairly hard on myself. Even
though I don't always live up to it, I strive to make the most of my
time, keep my priorities straight, do what's right -- all that stuff.
But, on the other hand, do I really even pay attention to the fact
that lots of times I&nbsp;*don't*&nbsp;live up to it? Do I ignore my
failures to live up to even my own standards, let alone God's? So I
was looking for a wise thought that discussed my at-least-occasional
failures to live up to the standard, or a wise thought discussing a
true sense of repentance. I found a bunch about complaining about the
world, some about complaining about specific things, some about
celebrating God's creation..but not really any about repentance in a
personal sense. </P>

<P>So where is it? Where is my sense of repentance? Am I really okay
and all right and on track? Or am I just ignoring the areas that I
should be focusing on to improve (with God's help, etc). I really
don't know. People can tell me that I'm nice, or that I'm not, or
that I am hard-working, or that I'm not, or that I'm loving, or that
I'm not, or that I'm messy or that I'm not. Those are good opinions
and good input, but they are not God's input. What does God think of
me? How closely should I&nbsp;pick apart my life in line with God's
Word? I dunno. And if I say I don't know, is that because I really
don't, or because I'm not willing to look because of what I might
find? Yeah, probably that. If the alcoholic likes his beer but wants
to quit what should he do? I'm not an alcoholic (don't even drink),
but if I like my lifestyle more or less and don't want to have to
change what should I do?</P>

<P>Well, the answer is to suck it up and just repent (or at least
analyze the need for it). Or the answer is pray and ask God for a
heart of repentance. Or pray and ask God to reveal whether you need
to repent. Or something like that. Will I do it? Past experience
makes it doubtful. I guess I change gradually over time, but is that
good enough? I guess that God imparts his grace and knowledge to me
day by day, but is my filter so clogged by --whatever -- that only
like 5% of that knowledge actually gets through at a time? I dunno.
But I guess what I do know is that it's worth taking more time to
consider than I allow for it. So, self, think about these things, not
just in passing for 3 seconds or in a wise thought once every 25
years, but spend some real soul-searching time. Easy to say, I
know....</P>
