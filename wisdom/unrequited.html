<P><B>August 14, 1999</B></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>In my experience with relationships I
have encountered a disheartening problem. Many of you are probably
familiar with this problem: In your heart, in your inmost being, in
the part of you from which love and compassion and friendship flow,
you feel...something...for another. You (the seeker) feel a desire to
spend time with a person, to interact with them, to share thoughts
and conversations on both trivial and eternal subjects. But, for
whatever reason, usually with no fault involved, this "other person"
(the receiver) does not share that desire. In other words, your
friendship - your love, if you will - is unrequited, unreturned, and
in some cases, blatantly unwanted and only a burden to the
receiver.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>Friendship is such a strange thing. What
is it that draws us to another person? As I shared in another essay
such as this, there seems to be something beyond common interests and
shared experiences involved. There seems to be some nameless bond
that exists between some, but not others. When these bonds are
mutual, beautiful friendship develops, bright and free. When the bond
extends only one way, however, a struggle ensues - a continual
attempt by the seeker to befriend the other, and a continual attempt
by the receiver to distance him or herself from the seeker. Neither
is very happy in this pursuit, and neither is at fault. Both are
trying to be friends with who they enjoy being with the most. Neither
is sinning in doing so. But still feelings are hurt, love is scorned,
unrealistic expectations are placed on the receiver...in general,
sadness results.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>What is there to say of this? Very
little, it seems. There is no rhyme or reason in friendship, in some
sense. I can act in your best interest from start to finish - always
encouraging, always loving - but experience shows that if there is
not a return friendship bond given, only an acquaintanceship will
result, not a friendship. In some cases a simple form of friendship
may form, but it is a friendship which for the receiver is always
second to another "best friend." And in many cases, the seeker is
looking for a best friend, or at least an equal friend, not a second-
(or third- or fourth- or forty-second-) best friend. In some way, a
second-best friendship can be more devastating than not being friends
at all, because the seeker is close enough to feel friendship, but
always with the limitation that "You'll never be as good of a friend
to me as &lt;insert name here&gt;." This upsets either our sincere
care for another, or our selfish pride (depending on your
perspective).</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>This being said (that a seeker acts in
the receiver's best interests), we also must realize that it is
difficult indeed for a seeker to remain encouraging and loving and
without sin in the midst of unrequitedness. More often, the seeker
becomes bitter and calloused, selfishly seeking the love and
friendship of the receiver, at the expense of the receiver's own
requited friendships. So perhaps the original argument that this is a
"no-fault" issue is premature. It is interesting to note that the
sin, if we call it that, first appears in the one who at first showed
love and offered friendship.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>Now, for at least some folks out there
(myself included), one or more of these unrequited friendships can
lead us to dark conclusions. We feel unloved. We feel alone. We feel
that we may be respected, may be everyone's "friend," but no one's
"best friend." Even if we do have other friends, we feel as if we do
not. At the moment of unrequitedness, all the other goodness in the
world really does not matter. All that is visible is the rejection of
a gift. All of our friendships suffer, because we wonder how requited
our love is in our other previously stable and firmly established
friendships. Even our relationship with God, the great Lover and Lord
of our souls, suffers, as we begin to wonder why our feeble love is
not returned.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>So what is to be done? Usually, the
answer is (sadly) nothing. There is no way to change someone's
emotions. One can seldom change his own emotions, let alone someone
else's. One cannot make himself be wanted. The bravest answer is for
the seeker to pray and ask for a change of heart (of his own heart,
not the receiver's). But that change too, is often slow in coming,
apparently because the Father is in the process of teaching some
great lesson about patience or His holy love. In short, there is no
easy answer, and so these tend to be ongoing problems, hard to deal
with daily and much harder to solve with finality. On some occasions,
talking sincerely between seeker and receiver can help, but it can
also backfire in giving the seeker an ounce of hope -- a glimpse of
requitedness, which only starts the process of unrequitedness all
over again when the seeker realizes that the friendship given, though
sincere, is still not as "deep" as is desired.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>In many cases, the only satisfactory
solution is distance and separation between the parties. This
usually, over time, will calm the senses, except for periodic
longings for "reconciliation" or requitedness. The seeker will feel
this to be a violation of some idealistic principle of living in
harmony with all people, but as many are so fond of saying, "Idealism
is not reality."</B></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><B>So a good question to end with: Does God
want us to have best friends? The answer seems to be a fervent yes,
because we all need those with whom we can share the deepest parts of
our lives, but we definitely do not show those areas to just anyone
who happens to find themselves in "friendship" with us. But if we
have best friends, we automatically discount equality in friendship
in some cases (when two or more both vie for "best friend" status)
and without fail one is hurt in the process.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000066"><B>Disclaimer: I seem to feel the
need for a disclaimer here, although I'm not sure why. If you don't
agree with some part of this, tell me so, and there's a good chance
you might prove me wrong, and maybe even change my mind. I can only
relate to you what I have experienced or observed, complete with all
my personal biases. If you find yourself in one of these seeker or
receiver positions, and have a different perspective, let me know,
and I will amend my thoughts.</B></FONT>
